Zandile is a program manager at an iNGO and she needs to use CommCare, DHIS2,
and OpenFn for an upcoming public health project. She understands that all three
pieces of software can be deployed locally, or accessed as SaaS (Software as a
Service).

Essentially, Zandile needs to decide if she would like to run the software on
someone else’s servers (SaaS), or on her organization’s own servers (deployed
locally). Before making a decision she outlines the components of both options.

## What is SaaS?

SaaS stands for “Software As A Service” and this means that the software will
not be installed onto your company’s proprietary servers, but will instead be
hosted by the software vendor's company and can be accessed through the
Internet.

## Benefits of SaaS

With SaaS, the software vendor is responsible for the expenses of managing and
monitoring all of the technical components and issues associated with the
software. This means that Zandile’s iNGO will not be responsible for updating
the software, maintaining the servers, backing up the data, disaster recovery
etc…

Deployment of this option is super quick because you do not need an IT team
provisioning for this and maintaining it. This option also provides the greatest
amount of flexibility & scalability– because the SaaS provider is able to
deliver more or less computing power, storage, and bandwidth— right when it’s
needed.

## What is Local Deployment?

Unlike the SaaS option, the locally deployed option is hosted on your
organization’s own infrastructure/servers.

## Benefits of Local Deployment

Local deployment provides your organization with a greater sense of ownership
over your data. Your IT team will be responsible for ensuring high availability
and disaster recovery. Additionally, your IT team will need to manage all
software upgrades and the tangible hardware (servers) that run the software.

If your organization does not already have an IT team in place, then this can
become a costly headache, but for a large organization with embedded IT
experience, local deployment often makes sense.

## Zandile's Decision

Zandile’s decision is to locally deploy CommCare, DHIS2 and OpenFn because data
residency is a concern - her data is sensitive, and needs its own servers, and
CommCare, DHIS2 and OpenFn do not provide hosting in the country where the
software is needed. Plus, Zandile's organization has an experienced IT team that
has a lot of experience in server management.

## Which Deployment Option is Best for you?

The answer is: "it depends", but if your organization has never managed local
software deployments, then we recommend going the SaaS approach. SaaS systems,
like the one OpenFn offers, provide users with 24/7 expert supervision and they
can be easily scaled up or down based on your needs.

Should you need any help with your decision though please do not hesistate to
contact the OpenFn team.
