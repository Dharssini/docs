### Contributing to this documentation site

Visit https://docs.openfn.org/documentation/writing-docs/.

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern
static website generator.

- To create new docs pages, add markdown files (or JS files) to the `/docs`
  folder.
- To view those new pages via the navigation, add links to them in the header,
  footer, or sidebars.
- Note that page ids (which are required in `sidebar.js` are _either_ set
  explicitly _or_ automatically generated by docusaurus as the filename, sans
  extension.)

```sh
./sidebars.js
./sidebars-adaptors.js
./docusaurs.config.js
```

Installation

```console
asdf install
corepack enable
yarn install
```

### Local Development

```console
yarn start
```

This command builds the job library from OpenFn.org, starts a local development
server, and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without
having to restart the server.

```
yarn start-offline
```

This command skips the job library step, which requires an active internet
connection.

### Build and serve for full-featured testing

```console
yarn generate-library
yarn build
yarn serve
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be
served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Builds to `main` will automatically be deployed to
[docs.openfn.org](https://docs.openfn.org).
