#### Other documentation

#### Contributing to this documentation site

Visit https://docs.openfn.org/docs/style-guide.

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern
static website generator.

- To create new docs pages, add markdown files (or JS files) to the `/docs` folder.
- To view those new pages via the navigation, add links to them in the header, footer, or sidebars.
- Note that page ids (which are required in `sidebar.js` are _either_ set explicitly _or_ automatically generated by docusaurus as the filename, sans extension.)

```sh
./sidebars.js
./sidebars-library.js
./docusaurs.config.js
```

#####

Installation

```console
npm install
```

##### Local Development

```console
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

##### Build

```console
npm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be
served using any static contents hosting service.

##### Deployment

Builds to `main` will autodeploy.
