Leading organizations connect technologies to amplify their impact with OpenFn.

Technology isn't the answer, but it shouldn't be the problem. From household survey data in northern India, to attendance recorded at women's groups in Kenya, we are moving the data that makes impact-first organizations more efficient and effective.

OpenFn allows non-technical users to quickly and easily define `jobs` that move data between essential technologies automatically and in real-time. It's powerful data integration, *without* the need for developers.

#### Watch our founder's [PopTech Talk](https://player.vimeo.com/video/143660667) to see what we're all about, head to [OpenFn.org](www.openfn.org) for more information, or [contact us](mailto:admin@openfn.org) with any questions.

# How it works:

## `Filters` handle different types of `source` data.

## `Credentials` connect to different `destination` applications.

## `Jobs` automatically manipulate source data and load it into destination applications in real-time.

## `History` keeps track of every bit of source data, and each action taken in a destination system.

## `Inspect` individual items, modify payloads to handle errors, and reprocess data manually.

## `Edit` source data before resubmitting, using either our form-based editor, or the JSON-based `power-editor`.

## `Account` settings: Choose to get notifications on failures, and click to copy your secure HTTPS URL for setting up new datasources from hundres of web applications.
