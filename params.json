From household survey data in northern India, to attendance recorded at women's groups in Kenya, we are moving the data that makes impact-first organizations more efficient and effective.\r\n\r\nOpenFn allows non-technical users to quickly and easily define `jobs` that move data between essential technologies automatically and in real-time. It's powerful data integration, *without* the need for developers.\r\n\r\n#### Watch our founder's [PopTech Talk](https://player.vimeo.com/video/143660667) to see what we're all about, head to [OpenFn.org](www.openfn.org) for more information, or [contact us](mailto:admin@openfn.org) with any questions.\r\n\r\n# How it works:\r\n\r\n## `Filters` handle different types of `source` data.\r\n![filters](https://github.com/OpenFn/core-docs/blob/master/images/Filters.png)\r\n\r\n## `Credentials` connect to different `destination` applications.\r\n![credentials](https://github.com/OpenFn/core-docs/blob/master/images/Credentials.png)\r\n\r\n## `Jobs` automatically manipulate source data and load it into destination applications in real-time.\r\n![jobs](https://github.com/OpenFn/core-docs/blob/master/images/Jobs.png)\r\n\r\n## `History` keeps track of every bit of source data, and each action taken in a destination system.\r\n![history](https://github.com/OpenFn/core-docs/blob/master/images/History.png)\r\n\r\n## `Inspect` individual items, modify payloads to handle errors, and reprocess data manually.\r\n![inspector](https://github.com/OpenFn/core-docs/blob/master/images/Inspector_Many_Jobs.png)\r\n\r\n## `Edit` source data before resubmitting, using either our form-based editor, or the JSON-based `power-editor`.\r\n![form_editor](https://github.com/OpenFn/core-docs/blob/master/images/form_editor.png)\r\n\r\n## `Account` settings: Choose to get notifications on failures, and click to copy your secure HTTPS URL for setting up new datasources from hundres of web applications.\r\n![account](https://github.com/OpenFn/core-docs/blob/master/images/Account.png)\r\n",
