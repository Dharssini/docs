## What's an adaptor?

An adaptor is an open-source Javascript or Typescript module that provides
OpenFn users with a clean set of helper functions that help communicate with a
specific external system. In the past, we often referred to them as "language
packages" and the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but the
preferred way of communicating about adaptors is as follows:

- "What _**adaptor**_ is that job using?" ("That job is using
  `language-dhis2`.")
- "The DHIS2 _**adaptor**_ is called `language-dhis2`."
- "I don't have the right _**adaptor**_ for this job, let me install it by
  running `npm install @openfn/language-dhis2`.

In short, _most_ adaptors follow the naming convention `@openfn/language-xyz`.

## Where to find them

Here's a list of publicly supported OpenFn adaptors. Note that only some have
been migrated to our new [monorepo](https://www.github.com/openfn/adaptors) and
have their docs sites served here. For the rest, you can view the docs and
source by clicking into the adaptor and choosing your version.

### On the OpenFn platform

When creating or editing a job on platform, you can choose the adaptor to run
the job. This way you "import" the needed operations. Simply open the dropdown
list of adaptors, and click on one.

### On npm

Most of our adaptors are also available on
[npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40openfn).

#### Install on platform via npm

When using `platform`, you can install adaptors that are not part of the
recommended adaptors picklist directly from
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40openfn).

To install from npm, click on the _cloud download icon_ next to the adaptor
version picklist. In the **Select Unreleased Adaptor** dialog box, enter the
`adaptor name`(e.g. `dhis2` for `language-dhis2`) and the corresponding
`version number`(e.g. `v2.3.4`), as listed on
[npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40openfn), for the adaptor of your
choice. The platform will attempt to install the selected adaptor version it can
be used to run the specified job.

Note that, after this custom installation of the adaptor, `platform` will not
add this adaptor version to the picklist of recommended adaptors in
[JobStudio](/documentation/jobs/job-studio), but you are guaranteed that the
adaptor will be available to use in any of your jobs as long as you specify it
via the **Select Unreleased Adaptor** dialog.

## Building and extending adaptors

The source code and technical documentation for developing or extending existing
adaptors can be found on GitHub at www.github.com/OpenFn/adaptors.
