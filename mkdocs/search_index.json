If you find an issue with the documentation or want to share your custom functions, please  submit a pull request !   Wait, so, OpenFn does what now?   Good question:    A source application sends  messages  to your project\u2019s  inbox  when something happens.    Jobs  will be triggered, based on your  filters , and use the data in those messages to attempt specific actions in destination systems.    The  logs  are recorded so you can see precisely what happened and when and where it happened to take action in the event of a failed attempt\u2014like editing the job or even the source message and trying it again.    OpenFn has harnessed the extreme  stability and scalability of Erlang to coordinate these actions and provide users with email alerts, project management tools, and an online job writing IDE.  In this guide you'll find documentation to help you write filters and jobs, along with explanations of OpenFn's key concepts.

            "text": "Connecting Source Applications\n#\n\n\nMost modern web applications have a feature that allows you to \npush\n, \npublish\n, or \npost\n data to another URL when a certain \nevent\n takes place. This event could be a form submission, mobile payment, patient registration, or barcode scan submission from a mobile app. The key is that your source application will notify OpenFn when \nsomething happens\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to the \"settings\" or \"administration\" page for your source app, and look for a \nWebhook API\n, \nData Forwarding API\n, or \nNotifications API\n. Write to the developers of your application if none is provided out of the box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen setting up forwarding, select to send messages in \nJSON\n to your project's \ninbox URL\n. You can find and copy your secure inbox URL by clicking on the \"copy URL\" link in the bottom-right corner of the project in question on your \nproject dashboard\n page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoon you'll see new messages arrive in your \nhistory\n page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTriggers\n#\n\n\nTriggers run jobs. They can either be \"filter\" triggers or \"timer\" triggers. Filter triggers watch incoming messages and run them through jobs when they match the filter criteria. Timer triggers run jobs after a recurring interval has elapsed.\n\n\nYou, as a user, specify the filter \ncriteria\n which determines which messages in your inbox should trigger job runs. This means that if any segment of a message body \nmatches\n the string of \nJSON\n you gave as a filter, the filter will run and trigger a job (assuming you created one).\n\n\nThe filter criteria takes the form of a string of valid \nJSON\n. In a SQL query, this string will be used in the WHERE clause, for example:\n\n\nSELECT\n \n*\n \nFROM\n \nreceipts\n\n  \nWHERE\n \nbody\n::\njsonb\n \n@\n\n    \n{\nName\n:\nAleksa Iwobi\n}\n::\njsonb\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter Matching\n#\n\n\nTo illustrate filter matching, refer to the \nJSON\n strings below. Message \"a\" will match filter '1', but message \"b\" will not.\n\n\nfilter 1:\n#\n\n\n{\nformID\n:\npatient_registration_v7\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmessage a (MATCH):\n#\n\n\n{\nsubmissionDate\n:\n2016-01-15\n,\n \nformID\n:\npatient_registration_v7\n,\n \nname\n:\nJack Wilshere\n,\n \ndob\n:\n1986-05-16\n,\n \nmedications\n:\n \n[\nanaphlene\n,\nzaradood\n,\nmorphofast\n]}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmessage b (NO MATCH):\n#\n\n\n{\nsubmissionDate\n:\n2016-01-16\n,\n \nformID\n:\npatient_registration_v8\n,\n \nname\n:\nLarry Bird\n,\n \ndob\n:\n1982-03-21\n,\n \nmedications\n:\n \n[\nanaphlene\n,\nzaradood\n,\nmorphofast\n]}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage 'b' does not include \n\"formID\":\"patient_registration_v7\"\n and will not match filter '1'.\n\n\nCredentials\n#\n\n\nCredentials are used to authorize connections to destination systems. In the future, our adaptors will use credentials to fetch meta-data from source and destination applications and make the job writing process easier.\n\n\nSome systems (Salesforce, OpenMRS, DHIS2) require an instanceUrl, host, or ApiUrl. Leave off the final \"/\" in these Urls:\n\nhttps://login.salesforce.com\n or \nhttp://demo.openmrs.org/openmrs\n or \nhttps://play.dhis2.org\n.\n\n\nCredentials can only be viewed, or edited by a single user \u2014 their \"owner\" (or the person that created that credential). All the collaborators on a particular project can choose those credentials for use when defining a job.\n\n\nJobs\n#\n\n\nA job defines the specific series of tasks or database actions to be performed when a triggering message is received or a timer interval has elapsed.\n\n\nComposing Job Expressions\n#\n\n\nIn most cases, a job expression is a series of \ncreate\n or \nupsert\n actions that are run after a message arrives, using data from that message. It could look like this:\n\n\ncreate\n(\nPatient__c\n,\n \nfields\n(\n\n  \nfield\n(\nName\n,\n \ndataValue\n(\nform.surname\n)),\n\n  \nfield\n(\nAge__c\n,\n \n7\n)\n\n\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat would create a new \nPatient__c\n in some other system. The patient's \nName\n will be determined by the triggering message (the value inside \nform.name\n, specifically) and the patient's \nAge__c\n will \nalways\n be 7. See how we hard coded it?\n\n\nWhat you see above is OpenFn's own syntax, and you've got access to dozens of common \"helper functions\" like \ndataValue(path)\n and destination specific functions like \ncreate(object,attributes)\n. While most cases are covered out-of-the-box, jobs are \nevaluated as Javascript\n. This means that you can write your own custom, anonymous functions to do whatever your heart desires:\n\n\ncreate\n(\nPatient__c\n,\n \nfields\n(\n\n  \nfield\n(\nName\n,\n \nfunction\n(\nstate\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \nArray\n.\napply\n(\n\n      \nnull\n,\n \ndataValue\n(\npatient_names\n)(\nstate\n)\n\n    \n).\njoin\n(\n, \n)\n\n  \n})\n\n  \nfield\n(\nAge__c\n,\n \n7\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, the patient's name will be a comma separated concatenation of all the values in the \npatient_names\n array from our source message.\n\n\nAvailable Javascript Globals\n#\n\n\nFor security reasons, users start with access to the following standard Javascript globals, and can request more by opening an issue on Github:\n\n\n\n\nArray\n\n\nconsole\n\n\nJSON\n\n\nNumber\n\n\nPromise\n\n\nString\n\n\n\n\n*N.B. The runtime environment on the server is Node v6.5.0.\n\n\nOther than the expression tree, Jobs have certain attributes that must be set:\n\n\n\n\nFilter\n - The message filter that will triggers the job.\n\n\nAdaptor\n - The adaptor for the destination system you're connecting to.\n\n\nCredential\n - The credential that will be used to gain access to that destination system.\n\n\nActive?\n - A boolean which determines whether the job runs in real-time when matching messages arrive.\n\n\n\n\nSelected Named Functions\n#\n\n\nThere are lots more available in the language-packs.\n\n\nlanguage-common\n#\n\n\n\n\nfield('destination_field_name__c', 'value')\n Returns a key, value pair in an array. \n(source)\n\n\nfields(list_of_fields)\n zips key value pairs into an object. \n(source)\n\n\ndataValue('JSON_path')\n Picks out a single value from source data. \n(source)\n\n\neach(JSON_path, operation(...))\n Scopes an array of data based on a JSONPath \n(source)\n\n\nbeta.each(JSON_path, operation(...))\n Pre-release: new feature details coming. \n(source)\n\n\neach(merge(dataPath(\"CHILD_ARRAY[*]\"),fields(field(\"metaId\", dataValue(\"*meta-instance-id*\")),field(\"parentId\", lastReferenceValue(\"id\")))), create(...))\n merges data into an array then creates for each item in the array \n(source)\n\n\nlastReferenceValue('id')\n gets the sfID of the last item created \n(source)\n\n\nfunction(state){return state.references[state.references.length-N].id})\n gets the sfID of the nth item created\n\n\n\n\nSalesforce\n#\n\n\n\n\ncreate(\"DEST_OBJECT_NAME__C\", fields(...))\n Create a new object. Takes 2 parameters: An object and attributes. \n(source)\n\n\nupsert(\"DEST_OBJECT_NAME__C\", \"DEST_OBJECT_EXTERNAL_ID__C\", fields(...))\n Creates or updates an object. Takes 3 paraneters: An object, an ID field and attributes. \n(source)\n\n\nrelationship(\"DEST_RELATIONSHIP_NAME__r\", \"EXTERNAL_ID_ON_RELATED_OBJECT__C\", \"SOURCE_DATA_OR_VALUE\")\n Adds a lookup or 'dome insert' to a record. \n(source)\n\n\n\n\ndhis2\n#\n\n\n\n\nevent(...)\n Creates an event. \n(source)\n\n\ndataValueSet(...)\n Send data values using the dataValueSets resource \n(source)\n\n\n\n\nOpenMRS\n#\n\n\n\n\nperson(...)\n Takes a payload of data to create a person \n(source)\n\n\npatient(...)\n Takes a payload of data to create a patient \n(source)\n\n\n\n\nFor code block examples of job expressions, go to the \nAppendix\n.\n\n\nInbox\n#\n\n\nYour inbox contains the history of all messages that have passed in to your project, which may or may not have triggered a specific job. Messages are stored payloads or data that were sent via HTTP post to your inbox. They can be viewed in formatted JSON, edited, or manually processed (if they did not match a filter when they were originally delivered.)\n\n\nTo edit a message, click the \"pencil and paper\" icon next to that receipt. Be careful, as no original copy will be persisted.\n\n\nActivity\n#\n\n\nIn this section of the portal, you can view a list of all \"runs\" - i.e. individual job runs. This list is essentially a compilation of all jobs, messages and credentials flowing through your OpenFn account towards your destination system(s).\n\n\nRuns\n#\n\n\nRuns are attempts made on a destination system by running a receipt through a Job Description. Runs can be viewed and re-processed. Each submission has a \nsuccess\n, \nstarted_at\n, \nfinsihed_at\n, \njob_description_id\n, and \nreceipt_id\n attribute. \nStarted_at\n and \nfinished_at\n are the timestamps when the submission began and ended.\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Some runs may take a really long time, particularly if they are performing multiple actions in a destination system or if they are fetching lots of data from a REST api at the start of a migration. They will appear as red if they have failed. In the case of failure, refer to our \nTroubleshooting\n section below.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n#\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if my survey data from ODK needs to link to existing records in my Salesforce system but a respondent enters or selects an invalid \nexternal ID\n?\n\n\n\n\nGreat question, and don't worry, it happens all the time. Assuming you've already taken all possible measures to either pre-load external IDs in your ODK form or use more human-proof IDs (like barcodes and fingerprints) here's the flow of work:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the email, and inspect the reason for failure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n99% of failed runs on OpenFn are due to \nvalue mismatches\n. The \ncollected\n \nid\n in ODK doesn't match the \nexpected\n \nid\n in Salesforce. You must now chose to either:\n\n\nA. Edit the source \nid\n in your \nreceipt\n \n retry the attempt.\n\n\nB. Edit the related \nid\n in your destination system \n retry the attempt.\n\n\nC. Ignore the attempt\u2014this source data will never reach your destination system. (There have been reports of ODK Aggregate's JSON publisher sending dupliate values. If that happens and your run fails due to \"duplicate values\" on a particular unique field you can safely ignore the run in OpenFn.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditing data in your destination system can be done through that system's interface. Many tools that act as \nsources\n (like ODK) do not allow for easy editing and re-submission of data. You can use OpenFn to edit the source data before retrying the attempt.\n\n\nCommon Error Messages\n#\n\n\nThe most common error messages with English explanations are:\n+ \nDUPLICATE_VALUE: duplicate value found: ODK_uuid__c duplicates value on record with id: a0524000005wNw0\n - The insert is blocked because you are attempting to create a new record with a unique field with the same value as an existing record.\n+ \nRequired value missing\n\n+ \nExternalId not found\n\n\nDIY\n#\n\n\nOpenFn's core ETL tools are all open-source, and here we will explain how those tools can be used to perform ETL operations from your command line. You can even take this further and wrap them together in your own hosted service!\n\n\n\n\nETL\n = Extracting, Transforming and Loading of data\n\n\n\n\nTo get started, follow these steps:\n\n  1. Create an empty directory somewhere on your local machine (e.g. call it \"OpenFn\")\n  2. Open up a terminal, cd into the new directory, and git clone the following:\n    - \ngit clone\n \nfn-lang\n\n    - \ngit clone\n \nlanguage-common\n\n    - \ngit clone\n \nlanguage-xxx\n (an adaptor of your choice, from github.com/OpenFn)\n\n\n#### fn-lang (diesl)\nfn-lang is a coordination tool that takes a job expression, a JSON payload, an adaptor, and a configuration file, and runs the \nTL\n part of \nETL\n on command. It can be run from a command line, or built into a hosted web service.\n\n#### language-common\n`language-common` provides basic data manipulation functionality like `each`, `field`, and `toArray`.\n\n#### language-xxx\n`language-xxx` is a \ndestination adaptor\n that knows how to connect to the system in question and provides system-specific operations, like `relationship` or `upsert`. Examples: `language-dhis2`, `language-salesforce`, `language-openmrs`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncd into 'fn-lang'\n\n\n\n\ntype into the terminal the following commands (in order):\n\n\n\n\nnpm install\n\n\nnpm link ../language-common\n\n\nnpm link ../language-xxx (Whatever adaptor you chose. For this demonstration we will use DHIS2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a folder named \"tmp\" inside \"fn-lang\".\n\n\n\n\nInside \"tmp\", you need to create 3 files: \nconfig.json\n, \nexpression.js\n and \nmessage.json\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nHERE\n to get started by using some sample code for each of the 3 files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun fn-lang from the command line with the following:\n\n\n\n\n~/fn-lang$ lib/cli.js execute -l dhis2 -e tmp/expression.js -c tmp/config.json -d tmp/message.json\n\n\nCommand Explained:\n Execute an expression (-e) and load on some data (-d) using a language-pack (-l) and a destination configuration file (-c).\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Depending on which language-pack you have decided to use, you will need to change this command by replacing \"dhis2\" with the name of the language-pack you are using. E.g. \"openmrs\" or \"salesforce/FakeAdaptor\" (special case).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the results of the posted data! Open up expression.js and message.json to manipulate the outcome and get a feel for how it works.\n\n\n\n\nAppendix\n#\n\n\nSample code for DIY section\n#\n\n\nBelow you can find sample code to fill the 3 files required to run fn-lang - \nmessage.json\n, \nexpression.js\n and \nconfig.json\n.\n\n\nmessage.json\n#\n\n\n{\n\n  \nxform_ids\n:\n \n[],\n\n  \nversion\n:\n \nnull\n,\n\n  \nuser_id\n:\n

The  collected   id  in ODK doesn't match the  expected   id  in Salesforce. You must now chose to either:  A. Edit the source  id  in your  receipt    retry the attempt.  B. Edit the related  id  in your destination system   retry the attempt.  C. Ignore the attempt\u2014this source data will never reach your destination system.

You can even take this further and wrap them together in your own hosted service!   ETL  = Extracting, Transforming and Loading of data   To get started, follow these steps: \n  1. Create an empty directory somewhere on your local machine (e.g. call it \"OpenFn\")\n  2. Open up a terminal, cd into the new directory, and git clone the following:\n    -  git clone   fn-lang \n    -  git clone   language-common \n    -  git clone   language-xxx  (an adaptor of your choice, from github.com/OpenFn)  #### fn-lang (diesl)\nfn-lang is a coordination tool that takes a job expression, a JSON payload, an adaptor, and a configuration file, and runs the  TL  part of  ETL  on command. It can be run from a command line, or built into a hosted web service.\n\n#### language-common\n`language-common` provides basic data manipulation functionality like `each`, `field`, and `toArray`.\n\n#### language-xxx\n`language-xxx` is a  destination adaptor  that knows how to connect to the system in question and provides system-specific operations, like `relationship` or `upsert`. Examples: `language-dhis2`, `language-salesforce`, `language-openmrs`.   cd into 'fn-lang'   type into the terminal the following commands (in order):   npm install  npm link ../language-common  npm link ../language-xxx (Whatever adaptor you chose. For this demonstration we will use DHIS2)     Create a folder named \"tmp\" inside \"fn-lang\".   Inside \"tmp\", you need to create 3 files:  config.json ,  expression.js  and  message.json .    Click  HERE  to get started by using some sample code for each of the 3 files.    Run fn-lang from the command line with the following:   ~/fn-lang$ lib/cli.js execute -l dhis2 -e tmp/expression.js -c tmp/config.json -d tmp/message.json  Command Explained:  Execute an expression (-e) and load on some data (-d) using a language-pack (-l) and a destination configuration file (-c).   Note:  Depending on which language-pack you have decided to use, you will need to change this command by replacing \"dhis2\" with the name of the language-pack you are using. E.g. \"openmrs\" or \"salesforce/FakeAdaptor\" (special case).    Check out the results of the posted data!

Click \"view archived jobs\" to see and restore old jobs.\n\n\nstatus.openfn.org\n: is now live, providing continual testing of key OpenFn services. We run both message-filter-based and timer-trigger-based jobs every five minutes to ensure availability, as well as measuring the round-trip time (in ms) that it takes for a server in a different geographical location to send valid JSON to OpenFn then receive and process the 200 response. (This time will vary according to the location of your servers, but it's important to note that we test the full round trip. Our servers typically send out 200s in about 5-6ms, but you can expect the round trip to complete in closer to 750ms.)\n\n\nVersion 1.4.0 (2016-09-26)\n#\n\n\nNew features:\n\n\n\n\nRun \"matches\" directly from your inbox view.\n\n\nAlways display the latest notification, dismiss to scroll back in time.\n\n\nLogin and signup server responses\n\n\n\n\nRun \"matches\" from inbox:\n Users can now run matches in a single click from their inbox, getting notifications that runs have successfully started without having to navigate to the Message Inspector page for a given message. Look for the blue \"play\" button next to each match. Simply click to start running that job with the message in question.\n\n\nLatest notifications:\n User notifications will now be displayed \nnewest-on-top\n and when there are multiple stacked notifications users will be... well... notified. Click the small \"x\" to dismiss the latest notification, moving backwards in time until all have been read.\n\n\nLogin/signup errors:\n Until now, invalid login messages and duplicate singup emails had been only displayed in your brower's logs. (That's our fault.) You'll now see a handy \"invalid credentials\" or \"email already registered\" message when trying to log in or sign up.\n\n\nVersion 1.3.0 (2016-09-20)\n#\n\n\n\n\nNew version of language-salesforce allows users to \nalterState\n with a custom function.\n\n\n\n\nalterState:\n \ndocumentation\n\n\nVersion 1.2.0 (2016-09-15)\n#\n\n\n\n\nUsers can now select specific adaptor versions for their jobs.\n\n\nJobs will \"auto-upgrade\" unless locked to a specific version.\n\n\n\n\nAdaptor versions:\n  This means that the code beneath your job, once saved with a specific adaptor version, will never change. This is an important step forward for the whole community, as it enables more rapid progress\u2014especially considering the growing number of outside contributors\u2014without risking introducing instability to existing jobs.\n\n\nEach new version of an adaptor will have release notes introducing the new features or changes to helper functions. To allow easy upgrades, we will still mandate that all new versions are backwards compatible.\n\n\nVersion 1.1.0 (2016-08-29)\n#\n\n\nNew features:\n\n\n\n\nUsers can now run jobs based on \ntimers\n as well as filters.\n\n\nUsers can now view logs for all runs, not just the most recent.\n\n\nJobs are \"aware\" of their last running state.\n\n\nget(...)\n and \npost(...)\n are now supported using the language-http adaptor, allowing users to make their own HTTP calls in jobs.\n\n\n\n\nTimer triggers:\n On the triggers tab, users can set the trigger type to \"timer\" and input a whole number of seconds for the \"interval\". Any \"active\" jobs associated with this trigger will run periodically after the interval elapses.\n\n\nView logs for all runs:\n By clicking on an individual run from either the Activity tab or the Message Inspector, users can view the full logs for that run, regardless of whether or not a more recent run took place with the same job and message.\n\n\nJob state:\n When a job runs based on a timer, not an incoming message, it will preserve it's state for the next run. This feature is commonly used by language packs like language-surveycto, language-odk, and others to create a \"cursor\" to offset or limit database queries.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, \nfetchSubmissions(...)\n in the language-surveycto adaptor takes three arguments: \nformId\n, \nafterDate\n, and \npostUrl\n. The first time this job runs it will only fetch submissions \nafter\n the \nafterDate\n. If any submissions are received, it will take the last submission from the array (by date) and persist it in the \njob_state\n as \nlastSubmissionDate\n. The next time this job runs, say, 300 seconds (5 minutes) later, it will ignore \nafterDate\n and instead fetch submissions after \nlastSubmissionDate\n. While this particular helper function is very abstract (it does this one thing well) it's possible to write a job that simply alters the final \"state\" before completing, passing whatever data you'd like from \nTHIS RUN\n to the \nNEXT RUN\n of the job.\n\n\n\n\nget(...) and post(...):\n Have a look at this complex job using language-http. See how it is possible to provide a query and a callback for \nget\n while \npost\n takes a url and a body object. At the end, the user is setting state.lastSubmissionDate to \nsubmissions[submissions.length-1].SubmissionDate\n.\n\n\nSee the functions themselves at \nlanguage-http\n.\n\n\nget\n(\nforms/data/wide/json/someForm\n,\n \n{\n\n  \nquery\n:\n \nfunction\n(\nstate\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \n{\n \ndate\n:\n \nstate\n.\nlastSubmissionDate\n \n||\n \nAug 29, 2016 4:44:26 PM\n}\n\n  \n},\n\n  \ncallback\n:\n \nfunction\n(\nstate\n)\n \n{\n\n    \n// Pick submissions out in order to avoid `post` overwriting `response`.\n\n    \nvar\n \nsubmissions\n \n=\n \nstate\n.\nresponse\n.\nbody\n;\n\n    \n// return submissions\n\n    \nreturn\n \nsubmissions\n.\nreduce\n(\nfunction\n(\nacc\n,\n \nitem\n)\n \n{\n\n        \n// tag submissions as part of the \nsomeForm\n form\n\n        \nitem\n.\nformId\n \n=\n \nsomeForm\n\n        \nreturn\n \nacc\n.\nthen\n(\n\n          \npost\n(\n\n            \nhttps://www.openfn.org/inbox/some-inbox-uuid\n,\n\n            \n{\n \nbody\n:\n \nitem\n \n}\n\n          \n)\n\n        \n)\n\n      \n},\n \nPromise\n.\nresolve\n(\nstate\n))\n\n      \n.\nthen\n(\nfunction\n(\nstate\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nif\n \n(\nsubmissions\n.\nlength\n)\n \n{\n\n          \nstate\n.\nlastSubmissionDate\n \n=\n \nsubmissions\n[\nsubmissions\n.\nlength\n-\n1\n].\nSubmissionDate\n\n        \n}\n\n        \nreturn\n \nstate\n;\n\n      \n})\n\n      \n.\nthen\n(\nfunction\n(\nstate\n)\n \n{\n\n        \ndelete\n \nstate\n.\nresponse\n\n        \nreturn\n \nstate\n;\n\n      \n})\n\n  \n}\n\n\n})",

We run both message-filter-based and timer-trigger-based jobs every five minutes to ensure availability, as well as measuring the round-trip time (in ms) that it takes for a server in a different geographical location to send valid JSON to OpenFn then receive and process the 200 response. (This time will vary according to the location of your servers, but it's important to note that we test the full round trip. Our servers typically send out 200s in about 5-6ms, but you can expect the round trip to complete in closer to 750ms.)",

            "text": "New features:   Users can now run jobs based on  timers  as well as filters.  Users can now view logs for all runs, not just the most recent.  Jobs are \"aware\" of their last running state.  get(...)  and  post(...)  are now supported using the language-http adaptor, allowing users to make their own HTTP calls in jobs.   Timer triggers:  On the triggers tab, users can set the trigger type to \"timer\" and input a whole number of seconds for the \"interval\". Any \"active\" jobs associated with this trigger will run periodically after the interval elapses.  View logs for all runs:  By clicking on an individual run from either the Activity tab or the Message Inspector, users can view the full logs for that run, regardless of whether or not a more recent run took place with the same job and message.  Job state:  When a job runs based on a timer, not an incoming message, it will preserve it's state for the next run. This feature is commonly used by language packs like language-surveycto, language-odk, and others to create a \"cursor\" to offset or limit database queries.   For example,  fetchSubmissions(...)  in the language-surveycto adaptor takes three arguments:  formId ,  afterDate , and  postUrl . The first time this job runs it will only fetch submissions  after  the  afterDate . If any submissions are received, it will take the last submission from the array (by date) and persist it in the  job_state  as  lastSubmissionDate . The next time this job runs, say, 300 seconds (5 minutes) later, it will ignore  afterDate  and instead fetch submissions after  lastSubmissionDate . While this particular helper function is very abstract (it does this one thing well) it's possible to write a job that simply alters the final \"state\" before completing, passing whatever data you'd like from  THIS RUN  to the  NEXT RUN  of the job.   get(...) and post(...):  Have a look at this complex job using language-http. See how it is possible to provide a query and a callback for  get  while  post  takes a url and a body object. At the end, the user is setting state.lastSubmissionDate to  submissions[submissions.length-1].SubmissionDate .  See the functions themselves at  language-http .  get ( forms/data/wide/json/someForm ,   { \n   query :   function ( state )   { \n     return   {   date :   state . lastSubmissionDate   ||   Aug 29, 2016 4:44:26 PM } \n   }, \n   callback :   function ( state )   { \n     // Pick submissions out in order to avoid `post` overwriting `response`. \n     var   submissions   =   state . response . body ; \n     // return submissions \n     return   submissions . reduce ( function ( acc ,   item )   { \n         // tag submissions as part of the  someForm  form \n         item . formId   =   someForm \n         return   acc . then ( \n           post ( \n             https://www.openfn.org/inbox/some-inbox-uuid , \n             {   body :   item   } \n           ) \n         ) \n       },   Promise . resolve ( state )) \n       . then ( function ( state )   { \n         if   ( submissions . length )   { \n           state . lastSubmissionDate   =   submissions [ submissions . length - 1 ]. SubmissionDate \n         } \n         return   state ; \n       }) \n       . then ( function ( state )   { \n         delete   state . response \n         return   state ; \n       }) \n   }  })",
