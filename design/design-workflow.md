# Designing your first OpenFn workflow

This article explains how to use the information gathered during discovery to determine the specific workflow steps, design your workflow, and draft a diagram to document the steps in the process you would like to automate. 

## Why diagram your workflow?
During requirements gathering you might outline the new workflow with a list of steps or use existing documentation on a business process/protocol. 
__For example:__
1. New patient visits clinic
2. Worker registers patient in mobile app (KoboToolBox)
3. Every day, sync new patients to national health information system (DHIS2)

Next, consider visually outlining the structure and flow of a workflow to ensure it can be more easily understood by various stakeholders. Diagraming can help to capture: 
1. The right flow/sequence of steps,
2. Dependencies,
3. Redundancies, and
4. Who is responsible for each step 


## Main steps to workflow diagramming
1. Diagram the human/manual process steps of this workflow,
2. Identify opportunities for automation,
3. Detail the functional steps of the ideal automation process, 
4. Share the diagram with all stakeholders for final sign off, and update it as necessary

The output of this exercise is clear documentation on how a business process will be executed by automation, humans, and often a combination of both. 

## Diagram using global standards
When diagramming, consider using global standards like BPMN (business process model and notation) so that diagrams are consistent and can be understood by outside parties. 

1. There are lots of online resources to learn basic concepts like this post. 
2. The OpenFn team has compiled some learning resources and BPMN diagramming tools in this document. 

Your organization may already be using a different standard notation (e.g., UML). Whatâ€™s important is consistency across your documentation to ensure that your solutions can be easily understood by other stakeholders.
