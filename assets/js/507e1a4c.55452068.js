Even when\\nusing the `--cache-from` flag when building, docker only caches the last image.\\n\\nOne proposed solution<sup>[1](#ref1)</sup>, is to pull, build and push each\\nindividual stage. Coming with tight coupling between the shape of your\\nDockerfile and your build process/scripts.\\n\\nThe other solution uses Docker Buildx which the document describes as:\\n\\n> Docker Buildx is a CLI plugin that extends the docker command with the full\\n> support of the features provided by Moby BuildKit builder toolkit. It provides\\n> the same user experience as docker build with many new features like creating\\n> scoped builder instances and building against multiple nodes concurrently.\\n\\nWhile that sounds pretty cool, it doesn\'t really touch on caching. This actually\\ntook me a while to find out that it would in fact do caching very differently.\\nIn fact it\'s a very different experience using it, and has lots of really cool\\nfeatures that further detach you from the local docker state allowing you to\\nbuild in environments that are stateless - such as Google CloudBuild without\\nhaving to wire up some kind of persistence or file caching scheme.\\n\\n## Buildx\\n\\nWe\'re only going to scratch the surface of Buildx, and with that let\'s get the\\nabsolute minimum working; build our image locally.\\n\\n### Local Cache\\n\\nFirst things first we need to create a builder, and select it for use. This is\\nimportant as without creating a buildx builder (and setting it as the default),\\nbuildx will use the `docker` driver instead of the `docker-container` driver\\nwhich we want in order to take advantage of cache exporting.\\n\\n```\\ndocker buildx create --name mybuilder --use\\n```\\n\\n> You only need to run this once, except in the case of CloudBuild where each\\n> invocation is a new node.\\n\\n```\\ndocker buildx build \\\\\\n  --cache-from=type=local,src=/tmp/buildx-cache \\\\\\n  --cache-to=type=local,dest=/tmp/buildx-cache \\\\\\n  --load \\\\\\n  .\\n```\\n\\nWhile the `--cache-*` options aren\'t specifically required when running `build`,\\nas `buildx` does manage its own local cache (distinct from the regular docker\\ncache), it\'s there to emphasise the options that cache can be provided via the\\nCLI options.\\n\\nThis is about as close as you get to a regular docker build, with the\\nsignificant difference being that you have to specify where to cache from and\\nto.\\n\\nThe `--load` flag is to tell buildx to set the output to the local docker\\ndaemon. Without that you won\'t actually get a resulting image to run. However,\\ndepending on your use case, this could be seen as a convenience - if you\'re\\nwanting to run your tests inside your build; a resulting image isn\'t\\nparticularly useful.\\n\\n### Remote Cache\\n\\nNow comes to the part I\'m most interested in, caching in a stateless/remote\\nenvironment. Multipart builds for us at OpenFn are essential, since we use\\nElixir and like other compiled languages there is a lot to be gained by only\\nshipping the stuff you\'re going to run; and no language is safe from requiring\\nseveral times more \'stuff\' in order to build our apps.\\n\\nBuildx supports a\\n[handful of different types](https://github.com/docker/buildx/blob/master/docs/reference/buildx_build.md#-export-build-cache-to-an-external-cache-destination---cache-to)\\nof caching sources and destinations. We\'re going to be using the `registry`\\ntype, where you point the cache at a repository reference (repo/image:tag\\nstyle).\\n\\n> One thing to note is that Google Container Registry does not support the\\n> metadata/manifest format that buildx uses, so if you\'re using Google Cloud you\\n> will need to start using Artifact Registry.\\n\\n**Inline**\\n\\nPush the image and the cache together:\\n\\n```\\n...\\n--cache-from=type=registry,ref=$IMAGE_NAME \\\\\\n--cache-to=type=inline \\\\\\n...\\n```\\n\\nThis comes with the constraint that cache mode is always `min`, which only\\nexports/caches the resulting layers; which is still better than the plain docker\\nbuild caching but I think having the intermediary layers is generally a win. We\\nwant to avoid a single line change invalidating an entire build step.\\n\\n**Registry**\\n\\nResulting image and cache are separated:\\n\\n```\\n...\\n--cache-from=type=registry,ref=$IMAGE_NAME-build-cache \\\\\\n--cache-to=type=registry,ref=$IMAGE_NAME-build-cache,mode=max \\\\\\n...\\n```\\n\\nAgain coming back to the cache mode, here being `max`; all intermediary laters\\nare exported to the cache image as well.\\n\\nI have opted to create _two_ images, one for caching and another for the\\nresulting image used to deploy. This gains us a much more granular cache and the\\nability to more easily manage the cache image - like deleting the whole thing\\nwhen wanting to invalidate the cache. Not to mention I\'m fairly sure the size of\\nour images that get pulled on kubernetes would get significantly larger with\\nmany more layers.\\n\\nIt feels like a safer bet to have lean images for kubernetes to pull, and chunky\\ncache images specifically for speeding up build.\\n\\nDepending on your setup, pulling large images can get _seriously_ expensive in a\\nreasonably active deployment environment - like on AWS ECS without using\\nPrivateLink.\\n\\n> It appears the `moby/buildkit` documentation also demonstrates\\n> [this](https://github.com/moby/buildkit#registry-push-image-and-cache-separately)\\n> approach.\\n\\n```\\nIMAGE_NAME=us-east4-docker.pkg.dev/<project-name>/platform/app \\\\\\ndocker buildx build \\\\\\n  -t $IMAGE_NAME:latest \\\\\\n  --cache-from=type=registry,ref=$IMAGE_NAME-build-cache \\\\\\n  --cache-to=type=registry,ref=$IMAGE_NAME-build-cache,mode=max \\\\\\n  --push \\\\\\n  --progress=plain \\\\\\n  .\\n```\\n\\nThis implies that the cache image is named with the suffix `-build-cache`:  \\n`us-east4-docker.pkg.dev/<project-name>/platform/app[-build-cache]`.\\n\\nThe `--push` argument tells buildx to push the resulting image to the registry.\\n\\n## Tips\\n\\n**Clearing the local cache**\\n\\nAs mentioned before, buildx has its own cache and in order to clear the cache\\nwhile debugging and readying a Dockerfile for remote building you\'ll probably\\nneed to reach for `docker buildx prune`.\\n\\n## Closing thoughts\\n\\nUsing buildx has been a really pleasant experience, having personally attempted\\nusing it a few times over the last 3 years; the most recent one being the first\\ntime I felt confident getting it into production. As with any sufficiently\\nflexible build tooling, the errors and issues you can run into range from\\ncomplete gibberish, genuinely concerning inconsistencies to architectural\\nchoices that you haven\'t fully caught up on; requiring an ever growing list of\\nchanges you need to make to your own build process.\\n\\nOur initial observations have been great, reasonable changes on our build have\\ngone from 28 minutes to around 9 minutes.\\n\\nWhile I have encountered a few confusing cache invalidations, especially when\\nbuilding locally, exporting the cache to a repository and then having CloudBuild\\nuse the image cache. And occasionally locally having what feels like _really_\\naggressive caching on intermediate steps, leading me to pruning the local cache.\\n\\nBut overall, these issues aren\'t necessarily buildx issues and more likely a\\ncombination of building docker images in general except with many more steps\\naccounted for by the cache.\\n\\nIt\'s kinda hard to see now what the exact issues I had with it in the past, but\\nhey!\\n\\nBuildx has given me what I \'expected\' with docker multi-stage builds, and having\\nthe cache in a repository completely side-steps having to attach a shared volume\\nor copying from a storage bucket.\\n\\n## Resources\\n\\n- [Multi-stage builds #3: Speeding up your builds](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/faster-multi-stage-builds/)\\n  <a name=\\"ref1\\"><sup>1</sup></a>\\n- [Docker Buildx](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/)\\n- [buildx build reference](https://github.com/docker/buildx/blob/master/docs/reference/buildx_build.md#buildx-build)\\n- [mody/buildkey Registry cache exporter](https://github.com/moby/buildkit#registry-push-image-and-cache-separately)"},{"id":"Wrapping my head around jobs","metadata":{"permalink":"/articles/2021/07/05/wrapping-my-head-around-jobs","editUrl":"https://github.com/openfn/docs/edit/main/articles/2021-07-05-wrapping-my-head-around-jobs.md","source":"@site/articles/2021-07-05-wrapping-my-head-around-jobs.md","title":"Wrapping my head around jobs","description":"Jobs are business processes turned into functional-style scripts.

What does that\\nmean, how should you approach writing jobs?\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nFirst, this is how _I_ think about jobs and what we do at Open Function Group to\\ntry to make our job code as readable, future-proof, and concise as possible.\\nThere are a million different ways to approach writing jobs. This is one.\\n\\n## It all starts with `state`\\n\\nIf a job is a set of instructions for a chef (a recipe?) then the initial\\n`state` is all of the ingredients they need tied up in a perfect little bundle.\\nIt usually looks something like this:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"configuration\\": {\\n    \\"hostUrl\\": \\"https://moh.kenya.gov.ke/dhis2\\",\\n    \\"username\\": \\"taylor\\",\\n    \\"password\\": \\"very-secret\\"\\n  },\\n  \\"data\\": {\\n    \\"type\\": \\"registration\\",\\n    \\"patient\\": {\\n      \\"age\\": 24,\\n      \\"gender\\": \\"M\\",\\n      \\"nationalId\\": \\"321cs7\\"\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis might be the initial `state` for a real-time, message-triggered job. Some\\nsource system generated a new patient payload and sent that payload to OpenFn.\\nThe data from our source system will wind up in `state.data`. Now if my job is\\nmeant to take this new patient registration information and use it to create a\\nnew record in the national health record system, I\'ll also need to provide my\\nrobot-chef here with a credential so they can access that system. The credential\\nI\'ve specified will get put into `state.configuration` and now our \\"raw\\ningredients\\" are all ready for our robot chef.\\n\\nNote that even if this job was initiated by a cron trigger (e.g., \\"Hey chef,\\nprepare this recipe every Tuesday at 7pm\\") or by a flow/catch trigger (e.g.,\\n\\"Hey chef, prepare this recipe only when you _fail_ to make banana pancakes\\") it\\nwill have an initial state.\\n\\n**Every job, and every operation inside that job (think \\"step\\" in a recipe) is\\ncalled with `state` and returns `state` when it\'s done.**\\n\\nInitial state for a cron triggered job might look like this:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"configuration\\": {\\n    \\"hostUrl\\": \\"https://moh.kenya.gov.ke\\",\\n    \\"apiKey\\": \\"abc123\\"\\n  },\\n  \\"data\\": {},\\n  \\"lastProcessedId\\": 321\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAnd for a fail triggered job like this:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"configuration\\": {\\n    \\"hostUrl\\": \\"https://moh.kenya.gov.ke\\",\\n    \\"apiKey\\": \\"abc123\\"\\n  },\\n  \\"data\\": {},\\n  \\"lastProcessedId\\": 321,\\n  \\"error\\": [\\"Required field missing\\", \\"Patient Surname\\", \\"Line 43\\"]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNo matter what, jobs start with state. See\\n[\\"Initial and final state for runs\\"](/documentation/jobs/state/) for a detailed\\nbreakdown.\\n\\n## It ends with `state` too\\n\\nNow that we\'ve got it in our heads that `state` is the raw ingredients you hand\\nto your chef when you ask them to prepare a recipe, let\'s look at the recipe.\\nBoiled down (excuse the pun) a job for loading those patients into the national\\nhealth record system might look like this:\\n\\n```js\\nget(\'/api/insuranceRegistrations\');\\npost(\'/api/patients\', { ...someData });\\npost(\'/api/visits\', { ...someData });\\n```\\n\\nWe\'re telling our chef to take those raw ingredients (login info for our\\nnational health system and a chunk of information about a newly registered\\npatient) and do the following:\\n\\n1. Find out whether this person already has a national health insurance number\\n2. Add this person to the patient registry (making use of some insurance data\\n   from step 1)\\n3. Add a visit record with information about this initial visit (making use of\\n   patient registry data from step 2)\\n\\nWhen all of this is done, we\'ll not only have a new patient and visit logged in\\nthe national health registry, but we\'ll also return a final `state` object with\\ninformation about what we\'ve done that can be used in subsequent jobs. Imagine\\nthat we want to make a cash transfer to this patient so that they can take a cab\\nto the next visit\u2014we might create a job with the Mpesa adaptor that takes the\\nfinal state of this first job as its _initial state_. In this way, jobs are\\ncomposable.\\n\\nBut what about the complexity inside our job\u2014in order to complete step 2, we\\nneed some data from the insurance registry and we only get that data in step 1.\\nCrucially, each operation (again, think \\"step\\" in a recipe) takes state and\\nreturns state. In effect, the OpenFn execution pipeline simply calls all of your\\naction methods _with state_, passing it along from one operation to the next,\\nwaiting for each to finish and using the output from the first as the input for\\nthe second.\\n\\nWhile you may write your `get`, `post`, `post` job as it\'s show above, the way\\nit\'s handled by OpenFn is actually more like:\\n\\n```js\\nreturn get(\'/api/insurance\', { ...useDataFromState })(state)\\n  .then(state2 => post(\'/api/\', { ...useDataFromState2 })(state2))\\n  .then(state3 => post(\'/api/visits\', { ...useDataFromState3 })(state3));\\n```\\n\\nEach of these operations returns a function which _takes state_ and returns\\nstate. This means that _within_ a job, you are essentially modifying `state`,\\ncreating/manipulating records in external systems, and returning `state`.\\n\\nIt opens up a really interesting world of possibility for data manipulation,\\ncleaning, or transformation. Consider what we might do _after_ we get data from\\nthe insurance registry but _before_ we create that patient in the national\\npatient registry:\\n\\n```js\\nget(\'/api/insuranceRegistrations\');\\nfn(state => {\\n  console.log(state.data); // let\'s look at the response from the insurance API.\\n  state.data.people.filter(p => p.HasActiveInsurance); // and modify the payload to only retain those with active insurance\\n  return state; // before returning state for our create patients operation.\\n});\\npost(\'/api/patients\', { ...someData });\\npost(\'/api/visits\', { ...someData });\\n```\\n\\nWe might even need to do some manipulation _before_ we send a `get` request to\\nthe insurance registry. That\'s no problem:\\n\\n```js\\nfn(state => {\\n  state.data.registrationType = state.data.age > 18 ? \'Adult\' : \'Minor\';\\n  return state; // before returning state for our create patients operation.\\n});\\nget(\'/api/insuranceRegistrations\', {\\n  query: { type: dataValue(\'registrationType\') },\\n});\\nfn(state => {\\n  state.data.people.filter(p => p.HasActiveInsurance);\\n  return state;\\n});\\npost(\'/api/patients\', { ...someData });\\npost(\'/api/visits\', { ...someData });\\n```\\n\\nHere, we\'ve added a step to modify the initial `state` before we send that first\\n`get` request to the insurance API. We determine if the new patient is a minor,\\nand then use that newly calculated data to apply a query to the insurance API\\nrequest.\\n\\nUsing `fn(state => state)` or `alterState(state => state})` is incredibly\\nuseful, because it allows us to separate our data manipulation, calculation, and\\nraw Javascript (which will be harder for low-tech users to understand) from our\\nexternal actions. Let\'s explore that some more.\\n\\n## Keeping external actions clean\\n\\nInside each operation we could do some data manipulation... all of these\\noperations, across the many different language packages, allow for inline data\\nmanipulation like this:\\n\\n```js\\nget(\'/api/insuranceRegistrations\', {\\n  query: state => {\\n    console.log(\\"I\'m doing some fancy stuff here.\\");\\n    return { type: state.data.age > 18 ? \'Adult\' : \'Minor\' };\\n  },\\n});\\npost(\'/api/patients\', {\\n  body: {\\n    name: state => {\\n      return `${state.data.firstName}${state.data.lastName}`;\\n    },\\n  },\\n});\\n```\\n\\nBut if you\'re interacting with both technical and non-technical users, it makes\\nfor harder to read jobs. Consider the following instead:\\n\\n```js\\n// Perform calculations...\\nfn(state => {\\n  // Create several new calculated attributes...\\n  state.data = {\\n    ...state.data,\\n    type: state.data.age > 18 ? \'Adult\' : \'Minor\',\\n    fullName: `${state.data.firstName}${state.data.lastName}`,\\n  };\\n\\n  return state;\\n});\\n\\n// Get insurance data...\\nget(\'/api/insuranceRegistrations\', { query: { type: dataValue(\'type\') } });\\n\\n// Create new patient...\\npost(\'/api/patients\', { body: { name: dataValue(\'fullName\') } });\\n```\\n\\nSince we often have non-developers creating the external operations like `get`\\nand `post` above, this pattern makes our handoff easier. The business analyst\\ncan say \\"I need to have a registration `type` field available for use when\\nquerying the insurance registry.\\" A developer might respond, \\"Great! How do you\\nwant to calculate it... I\'ve got all of Javascript at my fingertips.\\" That dev\\ncan then make as many API calls as they\'d like, perform as many\\n`map.reduce(...)` calls as their heart desires to complete that calculation...\\nso long as they make sure the hand off `state` to the business analyst\'s\\noperation with a valid `state.data.type` attribute.\\n\\nA final benefit of this approach is that it becomes much easier to generate job\\nscripts from Google Sheets. Our implementation team frequently works with\\nnon-technical clients to generate field maps that look like this:\\n\\n| Path to Source Data | Destination Field |          Auto-generated syntax (using concat) |\\n| ------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------: |\\n| patient.fullName    | name              | field(\'name\', dataValue(\'patient.fullName\')), |\\n| patient.age         | age               |       field(\'age\', dataValue(\'patient.age\')), |\\n| ???                 | type              | plz help us calculate \'type\' based on x, y, z |\\n| patient.sex         | gender            |    field(\'gender\', dataValue(\'patient.sex\')), |\\n\\nWe can then copy and paste the syntax generated in that final column directly\\ninto OpenFn and update the bits that need some sort of custom code, writing an\\n`fn(state)` block or an `alterState(state)` block before the external action.\\n\\n## Wrapping up\\n\\nSome key takeaways here:\\n\\n1. Jobs start and end with `state` \u2014 some raw ingredients that will be used in a\\n   recipe.\\n\\n2. Jobs are lists of `operations` \u2014 steps in a recipe that _each_ take `state`,\\n   _do some stuff_, and then return `state`.\\n\\n3. As you move through the steps in a job, you are modifying `state`. Each\\n   subsequent step begins with the final state from the previous step.\\n\\n4. It may be useful to keep all your custom Javascript data cleaning,\\n   manipulation, etc., in a separate operation (e.g., `fn(state)` or\\n   `alterState(state)`) so that your external actions are clean and easy to\\n   follow.\\n\\nFinally, taking a close look at how developers write those `fn(state)` steps\\ntells us a lot about what the job execution pipeline is really doing:\\n\\n```js\\n// here, \\"fn\\" is a function that takes state and returns state\\nfn(state => {\\n  console.log(\\"I\'m doing some cool stuff.\\");\\n  //  I might create some new attribute...\\n  state.myNewThing = true;\\n\\n  // And ALWAYS return state for the next operation to use...\\n  return state;\\n});\\n```\\n\\nI hope this gives you sense of how I think about structuring jobs and building\\ndata pipelines or automation flows on OpenFn. We recognize that this stuff is\\ncomplex, and are pushing our new documentation regularly, so please do get in\\ntouch if you think there are ways we could improve this type of\\nwalk-through/helper article.\\n\\nHappy integrating,\\n\\nTaylor"},{"id":"Forms and Cases: CommCare and event-based integration","metadata":{"permalink":"/articles/2021/05/24/commcare-events","editUrl":"https://github.com/openfn/docs/edit/main/articles/2021-05-24-commcare-events.md","source":"@site/articles/2021-05-24-commcare-events.md","title":"Forms and Cases: CommCare and event-based integration","description":"This is a quick one, but I just got off an exciting call with an organization","date":"2021-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 24, 2021","tags":[{"label":"how-to","permalink":"/articles/tags/how-to"},{"label":"tips","permalink":"/articles/tags/tips"}],"readingTime":8.955,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Taylor Downs","url":"https://github.com/taylordowns2000","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/taylordowns2000"}],"prevItem":{"title":"Wrapping my head around jobs","permalink":"/articles/2021/07/05/wrapping-my-head-around-jobs"},"nextItem":{"title":"Sync Like You Mean It: Thinking Through System \u201cSyncing\u201d Protocols","permalink":"/articles/2021/02/17/syncing-options"}},"content":"This is a quick one, but I just got off an exciting call with an organization\\nthat\'s going to set up some jobs to move data into Salesforce from CommCare and\\nrealized that despite this being one of our more common integration\\nrequirements, we haven\'t done a \'tips\' article for this type of project.

You can read about that\\n[here](/documentation/apps/commcare#forward-cases-andor-forms-from-commcare-to-openfn)\\nbut the key consideration at this planning stage is _when_ you\'ll be performing\\noperations\u2014`create(...)`, `update(...)`, `upsert(...)`, `query(...)`,\\n`(bulk(...)`, etc.\u2014in Salesforce and what data you\'ll have access to.\\n\\nEach time a form submission comes into CommCare, we\'ll get a copy of that\\nsubmission at OpenFn and can use that data to create or modify some records in\\nSalesforce.\\n\\nLikewise, each time a case gets updated (or created or closed) we\'ll get a copy\\nof the case with all the case \\"properties\\" and we can use that data to _do some\\nstuff_ in Salesforce.\\n\\nIf you are using \\"Form Forwarding\\", the `trigger` you\'d create in OpenFn might\\nlook like this `{\\"form\\":{\\"@name\\":\\"ART Adherence Self-Reporting Tool\\"}}` and it\\nwould trigger your `job` any time an \\"ART Adherence Self-Reporting Tool\\"\\nsubmission arrived from CommCare, giving that job access to all of the data\\ninside that submission.\\n\\n## Working with the data that comes from CommCare\\n\\nAssuming you\'re using making use of case management, the data that arrives from\\nCommCare will look something like this:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"__query_params\\": {\\n    \\"app_id\\": \\"some-long-id\\"\\n  },\\n  \\"app_id\\": \\"some-long-id\\",\\n  \\"archived\\": false,\\n  \\"attachments\\": {\\n    \\"1621866020043.jpg\\": {\\n      \\"content_type\\": \\"image/jpeg\\",\\n      \\"length\\": 16423,\\n      \\"url\\": \\"https://www.commcarehq.org/a/your-project/api/form/attachment/some-uuid/1621866020043.jpg\\"\\n    },\\n    \\"form.xml\\": {\\n      \\"content_type\\": \\"text/xml\\",\\n      \\"length\\": 2727,\\n      \\"url\\": \\"https://www.commcarehq.org/a/your-project/api/form/attachment/some-uuid/form.xml\\"\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \\"build_id\\": \\"0ec83881cd0e420dad5c24ed3a5452fe\\",\\n  \\"domain\\": \\"your-project\\",\\n  \\"edited_by_user_id\\": null,\\n  \\"edited_on\\": null,\\n  \\"form\\": {\\n    \\"#type\\": \\"data\\",\\n    \\"@name\\": \\"ART Adherence Self-Reporting Tool\\",\\n    \\"@uiVersion\\": \\"1\\",\\n    \\"@version\\": \\"2783\\",\\n    \\"@xmlns\\": \\"http://openrosa.org/formdesigner/59E1207B-969F-402D-9EEE-675504036F78\\",\\n    \\"administrative\\": {\\n      \\"coach_verification\\": \\"check_here\\",\\n      \\"visit_notes\\": \\"\\",\\n      \\"vist_notes_to_save\\": \\"\\"\\n    },\\n    \\"case\\": {\\n      \\"@case_id\\": \\"1ec51ee9-5aef-4bd2-b7eb-7599856251bc\\",\\n      \\"@date_modified\\": \\"2021-05-24T14:20:28.693000Z\\",\\n      \\"@user_id\\": \\"332e893dcd1b413686621bd80aae0cd3\\",\\n      \\"@xmlns\\": \\"http://commcarehq.org/case/transaction/v2\\",\\n      \\"update\\": {\\n        \\"consent_received\\": \\"yes\\",\\n        \\"home_visit_notes\\": \\"\\"\\n      }\\n    },\\n    \\"meta\\": {\\n      \\"@xmlns\\": \\"http://openrosa.org/jr/xforms\\",\\n      \\"appVersion\\": \\"CommCare Android, version \\\\\\"2.51.2\\\\\\"(463994).

The question is,\\nwhat should we do?\\n\\nWhen setting up for a self-service implementation on OpenFn, the most important\\nthing you can do at this moment is carefully enumerate the data entry process\\nthat you\'d like a real human to follow. You can translate it to a job script\\nlater.\\n\\nYou\'ll need to write this up for your own case, but in this fictional example,\\nhere\'s the data entry process.\\n\\n## The instructions for our worker\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nRight from the start, notice that we\'re being incredibly explicit with these\\ninstructions! We\'re using the \\"API Name\\" (instead of just the \\"label\\", which\\nmight be ambiguous) of every field we want filled out in Salesforce and we\'re\\nusing the specific \\"path\\" to the data we want this person to enter from\\nCommCare.\\n\\n**Why are we being so specific?** Because eventually, a computer will need to\\ninterpret this\u2014and they\'re _terrible_ with ambiguity!\\n\\n:::\\n\\n1. Every time a messaged is received with\\n   `{\\"form\\":{\\"@name\\":\\"ART Adherence Self-Reporting Tool\\"}}` in the body (this is\\n   our trigger)\\n2. Log into Salesforce and create a new participant with the `participant_id`\\n   you find in the `form.participant_information` section as their\\n   `Participant_Code__c`. (If one already exists in Salesforce with that code,\\n   then update the existing record instead.)\\n3. Fill out the following fields in Salesforce based on the CommCare data in\\n   this message:\\n   - `Name__c` with the data from `form.participant_information.name`\\n   - `Sex__c` with the data from `form.participant_information.gender`\\n   - `CommCare_Case_ID__c` with the data from `form.case.@case_id`\\n4. After you\'ve created (or updated) this participant in Salesforce, create a\\n   record of the visit with the `instanceID` from the `metadata` section as the\\n   unique identifier `Visit_Code__c`. (Again, if there\'s already a visit with\\n   that ID please update the existing record.)\\n5. Fill out the following fields for the visit with data from CommCare\\"\\n   - `Date__c` with `form.visit_information.visit_date`.\\n   - `Consented__c` with `form.visit_information.consent_given`.\\n   - Always set `Test_Status__c` to `true`, regardless of what\'s in the message\\n     from CommCare.\\n   - And relate this record with the `Community_Health_Worker` by their username\\n     in `form.metadata.username`.\\n6. Finally, add a record for each medication listed in the\\n   `form.participant_information.current_medications` array\u2014matching on a unique\\n   ID formed by a combination of the medication `name` and the `participant_id`\\n   so that we can update existing medication records if they\'re present.\\n7. Fill out the following fields for the medication:\\n   - `Generic_Name__c` with `name`\\n   - `Status__c` with `active`\\n   - And relate this record with the participant you created or updated in step\\n     2 via the `participant_id` field.\\n\\nPhew... that\'s the task. It\'s just a fictional example and things could be much\\nmore straightforward, or much more complicated than this, but it\'s important to\\nremember that if you can get to this level of **precision and granularity** in\\nyour data entry process, a tool like OpenFn can automate this for you in a\\nflash.\\n\\n## Translating this into an OpenFn project\\n\\nIf you\'re streaming data in from CommCare and you\'ve got your Salesforce system\\nall set up so that this data entry person can complete the above steps (are all\\nthe objects and fields created? are the right fields marked as \\"unique\\" and set\\nto be used as an \\"external id\\" in the Salesforce administration section? have\\nyou turned on data forwarding in CommCare?) then it\'s time to turn them into an\\nOpenFn project!\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nA quick plug: **Did you know that there\'s an\\n[OpenFn community forum](https://community.openfn.org)** where you can post\\nstuff like the \\"steps\\" above and get help from other OpenFn users and staff\\nconverting these steps into a real, working, OpenFn job?\\n\\nWell, you do know! Check it out at\\n[community.openfn.org](https://community.openfn.org)\\n\\n:::\\n\\n### Create a Salesforce credential\\n\\nWe don\'t need a CommCare credential, since they\'ll send data to us. Create a\\nSalesforce credential that will allow the OpenFn worker to log into your\\nSalesforce system.\\n\\nRead more about credentials [here](/documentation/build/credentials).\\n\\n### Create a message-filter trigger\\n\\n- Select `Message Filter` for the `type`\\n- Enter `{\\"form\\":{\\"@name\\":\\"ART Adherence Self-Reporting Tool\\"}}` for the\\n  `inclusion criteria`\\n\\nRead more about triggers [here](/documentation/build/triggers).\\n\\n### Create the job\\n\\n- Give it a name\\n- Select the trigger you just created\\n- Select the `salesforce` adaptor\\n- Select the credential you just created\\n\\nAnd convert the instructions above to \\"operations\\" by using the inline help\\nprovided by the Salesforce adaptor:\\n\\n```js\\n// Use upsert to create or update a participant based on their participant code.\\nupsert(\\n  \'Participant__c\',\\n  \'Participant_Code__c\',\\n  fields(\\n    field(\\n      \'Participant_Code__c\',\\n      dataValue(\'form.participant_information.participant_id\')\\n    ),\\n    field(\'Name__c\', dataValue(\'form.participant_information.name\')),\\n    field(\'Sex__c\', dataValue(\'form.participant_information.gender\')),\\n    field(\'CommCare_Case_ID__c\', dataValue(\'form.case[@case_id]\'))\\n  )\\n);\\n\\n// Then upsert a visit using the visit code.\\nupsert(\\n  \'Visit__c\',\\n  \'Visit_Code__c\',\\n  fields(\\n    field(\'Visit_Code__c\', dataValue(\'metadata.instanceID\')),\\n    field(\'Date__c\', dataValue(\'form.visit_information.visit_date\')),\\n    field(\'Consented__c\', dataValue(\'form.visit_information.consent_given\')),\\n    // Always set status to true\\n    field(\'Test_Status__c\', true),\\n    // And related this visit to the participant we just created by their \\"code\\"\\n    relationship(\\n      \'Participant__r\',\\n      \'Participant_Code__c\',\\n      dataValue(\'form.participant_information.participant_id\')\\n    )\\n  )\\n);\\n\\n// And finally for EACH mediation listed, create a medication record with a status\\neach(\\n  merge(\\n    dataPath(\'form.participant_information.current_medications[*]\'),\\n    fields(\\n      field(\'pID\', dataValue(\'form.participant_information.participant_id\'))\\n    )\\n  ),\\n  upsert(\\n    \'Medication_Tx__c\',\\n    \'Medication_Tx_ID__c\',\\n    fields(\\n      field(Medication_Tx_ID__c, state => {\\n        // Here, inside the medications array we\'ve \\"scoped\\" state so that\\n        // state.data, for each item in the array, looks like this:\\n        // { pID: 007, name: \\"sasstra-zenica\\", active: false }\\n\\n        // We will concatenate the participant ID with the medication name.\\n        return state.data.pID + state.data.name;\\n      }),\\n      field(\'Generic_Name__c\', dataValue(\'name\')),\\n      field(\'Status__c\', dataValue(\'status\')),\\n      relationship(\'Participant__r\', \'Participant_Code__c\', dataValue(\'pID\'))\\n    )\\n  )\\n);\\n```\\n\\nNow, every time this job runs (which is every time a CommCare form is submitted)\\nyour OpenFn worker will upsert a `Participant`, upsert a `Visit`, and upsert a\\nwhole list of `Medications` in Salesforce.\\n\\n## What\'s next\\n\\nWell, in our little example you\'d turn the job \\"on\\" (setting it to on the\\ninbound messages from CommCare) and let it run. Whenever there was a failure\\n(maybe your Salesforce admin added a new required field on the\\ncustom`Medication` object) you\'d get an email and you\'d have to come back to\\nOpenFn to update your job, including that new field.\\n\\nIf you\'re in the process of designing your CommCare and Salesforce systems at\\nthe moment, this back-and-forth will be pretty common. Keep in mind that you\\nwant as much simplicity as possible in those end-user systems because... well\\nbecause _humans_ have the interact with them every day!\\n\\nSo long as your processes are well defined, OpenFn can handle a bit of\\ncomplexity (data cleaning, transformation, complex logical flows, etc.) but you\\nshould never make sacrifices to the user experience in CommCare and\\nSalesforce\u2014that\'s a quick way to lose adoption.\\n\\nSo, ideally, you\'ve designed your workflows in CommCare and Salesforce to make\\nyour users happy and get them the information they need to do their jobs well\\nand _then_ you come back to OpenFn and spell out our data entry instructions\\nlike we\'ve done above.\\n\\n## A final thought\\n\\nThe two most important resources you\'ve got at your disposal if you\'re setting\\nthis all up on your own are:\\n\\n1. this site (docs.openfn.org), and\\n2. the [forum](https://community.openfn.org) (community.openfn.org)\\n\\nRead through the\\n[\\"What is an integration\\"](/documentation/getting-started/so-you-want-to-integrate),\\n[\\"OpenFn Concepts\\"](/documentation/getting-started/terminology), and\\n[\\"Build\\"](/documentation/build/jobs) sections if you\'re a thorough,\\nbackground-first kind of learner. If you crave snippets and sample job code,\\nhead directly to the [Job Library](/library) to see how other OpenFn users are\\ncreating their jobs.\\n\\nEither way, keep the community posted on your progress in the forum\u2014you\'ll find\\nlots of helpful folks willing to lend you a hand in your integration journey."},{"id":"Sync Like You Mean It: Thinking Through System \u201cSyncing\u201d Protocols","metadata":{"permalink":"/articles/2021/02/17/syncing-options","editUrl":"https://github.com/openfn/docs/edit/main/articles/2021-02-17-syncing-options.md","source":"@site/articles/2021-02-17-syncing-options.md","title":"Sync Like You Mean It: Thinking Through System \u201cSyncing\u201d Protocols","description":"\u201cSyncing\u201d is getting two systems to a state of harmony.

It might mean a lot of things, but the key concept is that when\\nyou sync systems, you\u2019re asking them to work together while simultaneously\\nrespecting both software systems\u2019 independence.\\n\\nIn this post we\u2019ll discuss two different syncing protocols to consider when\\ndesigning your data integration. These include:\\n\\n1. **Real-time, or event-based, syncs**\\n2. **Scheduled syncs**\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nFor a\\n[recent project in Cambodia](https://docs.openfn.org/blog/2021/02/09/interoperability_for_case_referrals),\\nOpenFn is being used by social workers to automate case referrals between the\\nsoftware systems Primero and OSCaR. In the design phase, we evaluated these two\\nsyncing options. Below, we\'ll explain what each one is, the differences between\\nthem and which option we chose in the end.\\n\\n### Real Time/Event Based Syncs\\n\\nThe first option considered for this integration was the real-time/event based\\nsync. This type of sync is triggered whenever a specified event takes place in a\\nsystem. With this approach, whenever a case is referred in Primero (via the user\\ninterface, i.e., when a real case-worker clicks the \u201crefer\u201d button) OpenFn\\nreceives a small payload with case data and transmits it to OSCaR and vice\\nversa.\\n\\n![Real_Time_Sync](/img/syncs1.png)\\n\\n\x3c!-- all diagrams for this article can be found here: https://lucid.app/lucidchart/invitations/accept/d36fb964-7c74-4e48-b248-7e25497883e3 --\x3e\\n\\nBecause of their instantaneous nature, real time/event based syncs are great for\\nintegrations that involve mobile payments or sms messages to recipients. Really,\\nanything that needs to be done \u201cnow\u201d! Additionally, depending on your data\\nvolumes real time syncs might save you money because you\u2019re only using resources\\nwhen specific events take place. For instance, in the above example, a run is\\ntriggered by a referral, so if there are only 10 case referrals/month, you\'d\\nonly process 10 runs each month.\\n\\nThis type of sync is great because it\u2019s instantaneous, typically quite\\nstraightforward to set up, doesn\u2019t require any \u201cstate mangagement\u201d on OpenFn,\\nand allows for the reprocessing of individual events. There are, however,\\ndrawbacks.\\n\\nFor instance, what happens if the app that\u2019s sending notifications to OpenFn\\nfails to send? What if AWS or GCP goes down, taking half of the internet with\\nit? If Primero \u201cthinks\u201d it sent the referral, OpenFn never receives it, that\\ncase might not get referred to Oscar!\\n\\n### Scheduled Syncs\\n\\n![Schedule_Dependent_Sync](/img/syncs2.png)\\n\\nThe second option considered, a bi-directional schedule dependent sync, solves\\nfor the issue discussed above. On a scheduled basis (every 5 minutes, for\\nexample) OpenFn checks with Primero and Oscar to see if case referrals need to\\nbe transmitted between the two systems and then refers the case if required. In\\nthe unlikely event that any of the software systems involved crash, the\\nstability provided by the bi-directional sync means that all data is preserved\\nand eventually makes it to its destination safely.\\n\\nThe major drawback here is complexity. We had to use 4 jobs instead of 2, and\\nthe job that is responsible for \u201cpulling\u201d data that\u2019s been updated since the\\ntime of the last successful sync has to keep \u201cstate\u201d\u2014or some sort of working\\nmemory of what it\u2019s done in the past. When pulling modified cases from Primero,\\nOpenFn now only pulls cases modified on or after `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` where\\n`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` is the time of the last successful, round-trip\\nsynchronization. OpenFn has built-in functionality to handle exactly this\\nrequirement, but not all ETL systems do and it\u2019s a design implication that must\\nbe considered.\\n\\nUltimately, for the project in Cambodia, we decided that this sync option is the\\nright choice because data integrity is more important than the speed of this\\ndata flow.

Before making a decision she outlines the basic, non-technical\\nconsiderations for both options.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## What is SaaS?\\n\\nSaaS is software that is installed and _runs_ on computers maintained by\\nsoftware professionals, rather than on your own computer. While those computers\\nmight be anywhere in the world, typically you\'ll access and _use_ this software via\\nthe Internet.\\n\\n### Some benefits of SaaS\\n\\nWith SaaS, the software vendor is responsible for the expenses of managing and\\nmonitoring all of the technical components and issues associated with the\\nsoftware. This means that Zandile\u2019s iNGO will not be responsible for updating\\nthe software to ensure compliance with new security regulations, maintaining the\\nservers, backing up the data, purchasing and managing uninterrupted power\\nsupplies, and providing a team of physical security guards to protect the\\ncomputers and data therein against physical theft.\\n\\nGoing the SaaS route is often faster and more secure, because you do not need to\\ndevelop expertise in \\"DevOps\\" or hire IT and physical security specialists. This\\noption also provides the greatest amount of flexibility & scalability\u2013 because\\nthe SaaS provider is able to deliver more or less computing power, storage, and\\nbandwidth\u2014right when it\u2019s needed.\\n\\nHaving smaller setup costs (you don\'t have to grow a software delivery company\\nof your own) often makes this a more economical choice for many, though SaaS\\nwill always come with some sort of ongoing fee\u2014a price per month or year that\\ngoes to the vendor to compensate for the time and money they\'ll spend to ensure\\nyour software works properly.\\n\\n## What is Local Deployment?\\n\\nUnlike the SaaS option, local deployment means installing and running software\\non your own computers\u2014typically on your organization\u2019s servers.\\n\\n### Some benefits of Local Deployment\\n\\nIf a SaaS provider doesn\'t offer hosting in your country and your government\\ndoesn\'t allow your data to reside on foreign servers (i.e., you\'re not allowed\\nto use things like Gmail, WhatsApp or Facebook for communicating sensitive\\ninformation) then local deployment allows you to use tools like CommCare, DHIS2,\\nand OpenFn while adhering to government data sovereignty regulations.\\n\\nLocal deployment also provides your organization with complete ownership of the\\nend-to-end system. Your IT team will be personally responsible for ensuring that\\nthe software works, is maintained, is secure, etc. If your organization does not\\nalready have an IT team in place, then this can become a costly headache, but\\nfor a large organization with embedded IT experience, local deployment often\\nmakes sense.\\n\\nUltimately, being able to directly hire and fire the people who are responsible\\nfor your software\'s proper functioning can be very useful. It means you have\\ncomplete responsibility for whether or not the solution succeeds.\\n\\nIf you\'ve already got the teams in place (security, DevOps, etc.) then this\\noption can be more economical in the long run. With a very good DevOps team,\\nmaintaining an extra piece of software might only occupy 20% of a\\nfull-time-employee\'s salary. For your security guards, if the software is\\ninstalled in the same physical location it\'s possible that your costs won\'t\\nincrease at all. While there will be very high setup costs, over time you may\\nrealize cost savings by running an efficient software delivery unit within your\\norganization that spreads its focus around a number of projects.\\n\\n## Zandile\'s Decision\\n\\nIn this fictional case, data residency is a concern\u2014her data is sensitive or\\ncontains PII\u2014and CommCare, DHIS2 and OpenFn do not provide hosting in the\\ncountry she\'s located. Zandile\'s organization has a large, experienced IT team\\nthat has managed high-availability software projects for many years... they\'re\\npros. While they anticipate that the setup costs will be quite high (around\\n$60000 and several months for this set of deployments) they plan on using this\\nsoftware for the next 5 years and have determined that they\'ll recoup a\\nsignificant portion of that setup cost by not having to pay license fees for\\nSaaS. They go with local deployment.\\n\\n## Which Deployment Option is Best for your organization?\\n\\nThe answer is: \\"it depends\\", but if your organization has never managed local\\nsoftware deployments, then we recommend going the SaaS approach. SaaS systems,\\nlike the one OpenFn and CommCare offer, are simply going to be more secure, more\\nstable, and more scalable for the money.\\n\\nCrucially, you can always start with SaaS (most tools even offer a free tier)\\nand then decide later to invest in the big startup costs of a local deployment\\nif the license fees for the SaaS feel high enough to make local deployment more\\neconomical over the long term. After a few months or years on the SaaS, you\'ll\\nlikely be in a better position to know if you want to continue using the\\nsoftware for 5-10 years.\\n\\nShould you need any help with your decision though please do not hesitate to\\ncontact OpenFn."},{"id":"Tracked entity instances in DHIS2","metadata":{"permalink":"/articles/2020/12/09/upsert-in-dhis2","editUrl":"https://github.com/openfn/docs/edit/main/articles/2020-12-09-upsert-in-dhis2.md","source":"@site/articles/2020-12-09-upsert-in-dhis2.md","title":"Tracked entity instances in DHIS2","description":"tl;dr: Lots of our users want to upsert tracked entity instances in dhis2, but","date":"2020-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 9, 2020","tags":[{"label":"how-to","permalink":"/articles/tags/how-to"},{"label":"tips","permalink":"/articles/tags/tips"}],"readingTime":1.71,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Taylor Downs","url":"https://github.com/taylordowns2000","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/taylordowns2000"}],"prevItem":{"title":"Our Servers or Yours: Thinking through deployment options","permalink":"/articles/2021/02/03/hosted-or-local-deployment"},"nextItem":{"title":"Product News: Enhanced Scheduled/Periodic Job Control","permalink":"/articles/2020/07/14/cron-is-better-than-a-timer"}},"content":"tl;dr: Lots of our users want to upsert tracked entity instances in dhis2, but\\nupserts aren\u2019t supported by a standard DHIS2 API endpoint.

Over the last 6 years, OpenFn has been implemented worldwide for a\\nwide range of use cases, including building real-time data monitoring systems,\\nstreamlining data cleaning pipelines, securely exchanging sensitive information,\\nand automating routine processes like uploading indicator results, sending\\nSMS/email alerts, making mobile payments,\\n[and more](https://openfn.org/solutions).\\n\\nBy connecting any app, OpenFn can integrate and automate all apps within a\\ndigital ecosystem. However, a question that we frequently ask our partners is:\\n\\n#### Just because you _can_ automate\u2014_should_ you?\\n\\nWhile integration and automation have the potential to enable scale and save\\ntime and money (we\u2019ve learned this from our\\n[partners](https:openfn.org/clients)), solutions require investment to set up\\nand maintain. These costs sometimes outweigh expected efficiency gains and\\nservice outcomes. Therefore, when evaluating the cost-benefit of investing in\\nautomation and integration solutions, we at Open Function Group typically ask 3\\nkey questions.\\n\\n#### 1. Security \u2014 Will automation limit the exposure of sensitive data?\\n\\nCan the exposure of sensitive data be limited by integrating with secure API\\nendpoints (rather than relying on human beings to interact with those data, for\\nexample)? Or by automating a data cleaning process?\\n\\n#### 2. Accuracy \u2014 Will automation increase data accuracy and reduce data entry errors?\\n\\nCan the process take place more reliably by limiting the opportunity for human\\nerror (in automating data manipulation or simple algorithmic work, for example)?\\n\\n#### 3. Speed \u2014 Will automation increase the speed of impact?\\n\\nCan the process be done more quickly via automation and is there value in having\\nit done faster? (The answer to the first part is almost always yes, but\\nsometimes there\'s not actually lots of value generated by doing something\\nfaster.)\\n\\n#### If you find yourself answering \u201cyes\u201d to these questions, it may be time to consider automating critical processes at your organization.\\n\\nTasks that meet these 3 criteria, take a lot of time to complete or are very\\nrepetitive, and/or involve moving data between apps are typically great\\ncandidates for automation.\\n\\nIf you find yourself answering \u201cno\u201d, then it may not be worth the investment in\\nautomation... at least not yet. This is especially true if these processes are\\nstill in flux or require a lot of human involvement to complete. That said, now\\nmay be a good time to refine your existing workflows, think about how your\\nprocesses might change at scale, and consider what _new_ processes, services, or\\noutcomes could be unlocked by automation.\\n\\n### Delegate your busywork to OpenFn, and try it today!\\n\\nIf you want to try out automation for your organization,\\n[sign up](https://www.openfn.org/signup) for OpenFn, free of charge.

Because we\u2019re not explicitly being asked to help redesign\\nprocesses at this organization, the client is \u201ctelling us how things are\u201d, then\\nexpecting us to create a relational database model that facilitates\\nbusiness-as-usual, only in a more efficient, digital way. Seems reasonable.\\n\\nThis organization runs multiple programs focusing on a handful of strategic\\nobjectives. They coordinate various activities in their target communities and\\nreport on those activities against numerous (sometimes overlapping) indicators.\\nSound familiar? As we get to the 3rd explanation of these programs, and the 11th\\niteration of the system schema, it hits me\u2026\\n\\n### Drawing a \\"relational object model\\" sounds technical, but it\'s actually an exercise in clear communication... and everyone can benefit from it.\\n\\nWhen we\u2014human beings\u2014wrestle with complex problems (like managing lots of\\nprograms, other humans, community stakeholders, etc.) we have the capacity to\\ntrick ourselves into thinking that we have wrapped our heads around a system\\n(for clinic registration, for after-school education, etc.) when, in fact, we\u2019re\\nengaging in mental hand-waving and are simply \u2018papering-over\u2019 sections which are\\nsecretly not just complicated, but totally incongruous with other parts of the\\nsystem. We can make ourselves believe that our logic is sound because we want it\\nto be sound, when in reality the organization might be held together by good\\npeople, not good, clear, defined processes. By learning a couple of key\\nconcepts, it\u2019s possible for non-technical people to articulate their thoughts\\nclearly using \u201cboxes\u201d and \u201ccrow\u2019s feet\u201d and see whether or not there is an\\nunderlying structure to their organization\u2019s information.\\n\\n### By forcing yourself to reduce complex systems to sketches containing only two elements, you\u2019ll be able to detect important conflicts and confusions in how you think about your organization that you might otherwise miss.\\n\\nIf you can\u2019t diagram the information structure in your organization using boxes\\nand crow\u2019s feet, it\u2019s a smell that something isn\u2019t quite right (or at least that\\nsomething isn\u2019t easily scalable\u2026 more on this later!). Let me show you the tools\\nin the toolbox and then wrap up by waxing poetic on people, processes, and\\ntechnology.\\n\\n### Boxes and crow\'s feet\\n\\n![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/box5.png)\\n\\nThe box is my favorite. It represents an entity in your data system. Entities\\n(like `teachers`) have attributes (like `name`, `phone number`, `date of birth`,\\n`gender`, etc.) Some people like thinking of entities as simple forms. The\\n\u201cTeacher Registration Form\u201d will ask for the teacher\u2019s name, phone number,\\ngender, etc. These are the fields on your teacher entity. By submitting one of\\nthese forms, you\u2019ll add a new teacher to your database. If you\u2019re an Excel\\nperson, the attributes are columns in your `teachers` table.\\n\\n![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/crowsfeet2.png)\\n\\nThe crow\u2019s foot is my second favorite. It\u2019s used to show relationships between\\nentities. We know that teachers are related to the sessions that they conduct.\\n(And `session` might be another entity, with fields like `date`,\\n`subject taught`, and `venue`, to name just a few.) The crow\u2019s foot allows us to\\nspecify exactly how they are related. On that session entity, we\u2019ll need to\\nspecify the name (or ID) of the teacher who led it. On the teacher entity,\\nhowever, there won\u2019t be a field to specify the name or ID of the session\u2026\\nbecause a single teacher can lead MANY sessions. This is a one-to-many\\nrelationship. The crow\u2019s foot (that little three-pronged fella) denotes the\\nmany. One teacher can have many sessions. One session, however, can only have\\none teacher. See the diagram below.\\n\\n![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/objectmodel3.png)\\n\\nIf we focus just on `teacher` and `session` and think back to MS Excel, we can\\nenvision a `teachers` table and a `sessions` table. Let\u2019s put them on different\\nsheets in the same workbook. On the `teachers` table, there is no column for\\n`session`, but on the `sessions` table, there _is_ a column for `teacher ID`.\\nWe\u2019ve just established a one-to-many relationship.\\n\\nNext time, we\u2019ll talk about what\u2019s going with the `attendance` entity above.\\nIt\u2019s sometimes called a \u201cjunction object\u201d or a \u201cjoin table\u201d, and it\u2019s what\\nallows MANY students to be related to MANY sessions. I\u2019ll write more on this\\nnext time, but there is no magic going on, no technicalities here. The way that\\nmany students are related to many sessions is through this Real World Concept\\nthat we call `attendance`. Attendance is what happens when a student shows up at\\na session. It\u2019s so important to get the language right in these discussions, and\\nmake sure that you\u2019re talking about real-world concepts.\\n\\n### Relational object models with lots of confusing terms are not \\"technical\\". They are \\"bad.\\"\\n\\nRemember that as you start to put pen to paper. And allow yourselves time (and\\nmultiple drafts) to get the boxes and terminology right. Understanding\\nrelational object modelling is an incredibly powerful way to organize a company.\\nAs I said before, if you can\u2019t model it with boxes and arrows, it\u2019s a smell that\\nsomething might not be conceptually sound.\\n\\n### A disclaimer and some thoughts on scaling:\\n\\nSome organizations do amazing work without good conceptual systems. They rely on\\nhumans, instinct, improvisation, nouse, and other not-so-clearly-defined things.\\nThey might do really great work. They might get the job done. But they need to\\nbe well aware of their condition and face it head on. If you can\u2019t systematize\\nyour program implementation processes, then you need to focus tremendous effort\\non finding and retaining the right people.\\n\\nA friend once told me that \u201cpeople are not scalable.\u201d I couldn\u2019t agree more, and\\ndefend my earlier stance that if your organization\u2019s information structure can\u2019t\\nbe defined with boxes and crow\u2019s feet, it may be very hard for you to scale\\nresponsibly. However, if you can create a ruthlessly efficient, world-class\\n\u201cpeople operations\u201d system (recruitment, training, management, compensation, HR,\\netc.) that ensures you\u2019ve always got the right people to figure things out you\\nmight be better off than those operating a well defined assembly-line with\\ninterchangeable parts. Alas, the middle way is probably the best.\\n\\nThat\u2019s all for now. More soon.\\n\\n_Need help organizing or scaling your organization\'s information or process\\nflows?
