There have been over 3,000 distinct jobs written with OpenFn, and they provide
the best way for newcomers to learn how to use the platform.

We're currently designing a "job library" which organizations can opt into,
which would share all their job expressions (without exposing source data, of
course) for the benefit of the broader community.

While we get this all together you'll be able to browse and search these
open-source jobs here.

In the meantime, please feel free to submit your own jobs by submitting a pull
request to this docs site if you think they'd help others.
