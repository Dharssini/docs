## The library is coming...

There have been **over 3,000 distinct jobs written** for the OpenFn platform,
driving efficiency across the social sector. These jobs have run millions of
times, connecting and automating critical technologies like CommCare, DHIS2,
Salesforce, Kobo Toolbox, and more.

**90% of at-scale OpenFn customers make their jobs publicly available** so that
other organizations can learn from their implementations, yet we’re still
constantly asked to find examples of jobs that “create DHIS2 entities from
CommCare cases” or “initiate payments when Kobo submissions arrive”.

The Job Library will **make this vast pool of real-world experience available**
to everyone, automatically collecting and organizing non-sensitive job scripts
from this diverse community of social sector integration experts to make data
integration safer, faster, and more scalable than ever before.

## In the meantime

While we get this all together you'll be able to browse and search through a few
jobs here. Please feel free to submit your own jobs by submitting a pull request
to this docs site if you think they'd help others.

We've just started our official "opt-in" program and are developing the code
that will extract data from the library API on OpenFn and build corresponding
entries here on the docs site, tagged by adaptor, adaptor version, and helper
function.
