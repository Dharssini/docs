# Connecting Source Applications
Most modern web applications have a feature that allows you to `push`, `publish`, or `post` data to another URL when a certain **event** takes place. This event could be a form submission, mobile payment, patient registration, or barcode scan submission from a mobile app. The key is that your source application will notify OpenFn when *something happens*.

1. Go to the "settings" or "administration" page for your source app, and look for a `Webhook API`, `Data Forwarding API`, or `Notifications API`. Write to the developers of your application if none is provided out of the box.

2. When setting up forwarding, select to send messages in `JSON` to your project's `inbox URL`. You can find and copy your secure inbox URL by clicking on the "copy URL" link in the bottom-right corner of the project in question on your **[project dashboard](https://www.openfn.org/projects)** page.

3. Soon you'll see new messages arrive in your **[history](https://www.openfn.org/receipts)** page.

# Triggers
Triggers run jobs. They can either be "filter" triggers or "timer" triggers. Filter triggers watch incoming messages and run them through jobs when they match the filter criteria. Timer triggers run jobs after a recurring interval has elapsed.

You, as a user, specify the filter **criteria** which determines which messages in your inbox should trigger job runs. This means that if any segment of a message body **matches** the string of `JSON` you gave as a filter, the filter will run and trigger a job (assuming you created one).

The filter criteria takes the form of a string of valid `JSON`. In a SQL query, this string will be used in the WHERE clause, for example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM receipts
  WHERE body::jsonb @>
    '{"Name":"Aleksa Iwobi"}'::jsonb;
```

## Filter Matching
To illustrate filter matching, refer to the `JSON` strings below. Message "a" will match filter '1', but message "b" will not.

### filter 1:
```json
{"formID":"patient_registration_v7"}
```

### message a (MATCH):
```json
{"submissionDate":"2016-01-15", "formID":"patient_registration_v7", "name":"Jack Wilshere", "dob":"1986-05-16", "medications": ["anaphlene","zaradood","morphofast"]}
```

### message b (NO MATCH):
```json
{"submissionDate":"2016-01-16", "formID":"patient_registration_v8", "name":"Larry Bird", "dob":"1982-03-21", "medications": ["anaphlene","zaradood","morphofast"]}
```
Message 'b' does not include `"formID":"patient_registration_v7"` and will not match filter '1'.

# Credentials
Credentials are used to authorize connections to destination systems. In the future, our adaptors will use credentials to fetch meta-data from source and destination applications and make the job writing process easier.

Some systems (Salesforce, OpenMRS, DHIS2) require an instanceUrl, host, or ApiUrl. Leave off the final "/" in these Urls:
`https://login.salesforce.com` or `http://demo.openmrs.org/openmrs` or `https://play.dhis2.org`.

Credentials can only be viewed, or edited by a single user â€” their "owner" (or the person that created that credential). All the collaborators on a particular project can choose those credentials for use when defining a job.

# Jobs
A job defines the specific series of tasks or database actions to be performed when a triggering message is received or a timer interval has elapsed.

### Composing Job Expressions
In most cases, a job expression is a series of `create` or `upsert` actions that are run after a message arrives, using data from that message. It could look like this:
```js
create("Patient__c", fields(
  field("Name", dataValue("form.surname")),
  field("Age__c", 7)
))
```
That would create a new `Patient__c` in some other system. The patient's `Name` will be determined by the triggering message (the value inside `form.name`, specifically) and the patient's `Age__c` will *always* be 7. See how we hard coded it?

What you see above is OpenFn's own syntax, and you've got access to dozens of common "helper functions" like `dataValue(path)` and destination specific functions like `create(object,attributes)`. While most cases are covered out-of-the-box, jobs are **evaluated as Javascript**. This means that you can write your own custom, anonymous functions to do whatever your heart desires:
```js
create("Patient__c", fields(
  field("Name", function(state) {
    return Array.apply(
      null, dataValue("patient_names")(state)
    ).join(', ')
  })
  field("Age__c", 7)
```

Here, the patient's name will be a comma separated concatenation of all the values in the `patient_names` array from our source message.

## Available Javascript Globals
For security reasons, users start with access to the following standard Javascript globals, and can request more by opening an issue on Github:

- Array
- console
- JSON
- Number
- Promise
- String

*N.B. The runtime environment on the server is Node v6.5.0.

Other than the expression tree, Jobs have certain attributes that must be set:

1. **Filter** - The message filter that will triggers the job.
2. **Adaptor** - The adaptor for the destination system you're connecting to.
2. **Credential** - The credential that will be used to gain access to that destination system.
4. **Active?** - A boolean which determines whether the job runs in real-time when matching messages arrive.

# Inbox
Your inbox contains the history of all messages that have passed in to your project, which may or may not have triggered a specific job. Messages are stored payloads or data that were sent via HTTP post to your inbox. They can be viewed in formatted JSON, edited, or manually processed (if they did not match a filter when they were originally delivered.)

To edit a message, click the "pencil and paper" icon next to that receipt. Be careful, as no original copy will be persisted.


# Activity
In this section of the portal, you can view a list of all "runs" - i.e. individual job runs. This list is essentially a compilation of all jobs, messages and credentials flowing through your OpenFn account towards your destination system(s).

### Runs
Runs are attempts made on a destination system by running a receipt through a Job Description. Runs can be viewed and re-processed. Each submission has a `success`, `started_at`, `finsihed_at`, `job_description_id`, and `receipt_id` attribute. `Started_at` and `finished_at` are the timestamps when the submission began and ended.

> **Note:** Some runs may take a really long time, particularly if they are performing multiple actions in a destination system or if they are fetching lots of data from a REST api at the start of a migration. They will appear as red if they have failed. In the case of failure, refer to our [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below.


# Troubleshooting

> What happens if my survey data from ODK needs to link to existing records in my Salesforce system but a respondent enters or selects an invalid `external ID`?

Great question, and don't worry, it happens all the time. Assuming you've already taken all possible measures to either pre-load external IDs in your ODK form or use more human-proof IDs (like barcodes and fingerprints) here's the flow of work:

1. Read the email, and inspect the reason for failure.

2. 99% of failed runs on OpenFn are due to `value mismatches`. The *collected* `id` in ODK doesn't match the *expected* `id` in Salesforce. You must now chose to either:

      A. Edit the source `id` in your `receipt` & retry the attempt.

      B. Edit the related `id` in your destination system & retry the attempt.

      C. Ignore the attemptâ€”this source data will never reach your destination system. (There have been reports of ODK Aggregate's JSON publisher sending dupliate values. If that happens and your run fails due to "duplicate values" on a particular unique field you can safely ignore the run in OpenFn.)

Editing data in your destination system can be done through that system's interface. Many tools that act as `sources` (like ODK) do not allow for easy editing and re-submission of data. You can use OpenFn to edit the source data before retrying the attempt.

## Common Error Messages
The most common error messages with English explanations are:
+ `DUPLICATE_VALUE: duplicate value found: ODK_uuid__c duplicates value on record with id: a0524000005wNw0` - The insert is blocked because you are attempting to create a new record with a unique field with the same value as an existing record.
+ `Required value missing`
+ `ExternalId not found`


# DIY
OpenFn's core ETL tools are all open-source, and here we will explain how those tools can be used to perform ETL operations from your command line. You can even take this further and wrap them together in your own hosted service!

> **ETL** = Extracting, Transforming and Loading of data

**To get started, follow these steps:**
  1. Create an empty directory somewhere on your local machine (e.g. call it "OpenFn")
  2. Open up a terminal, cd into the new directory, and git clone the following:
    - `git clone` [fn-lang](https://github.com/OpenFn/fn-lang)
    - `git clone` [language-common](https://github.com/OpenFn/language-common)
    - `git clone` [language-xxx](https://github.com/OpenFn/language-common) (an adaptor of your choice, from github.com/OpenFn)

    #### fn-lang (diesl)
    fn-lang is a coordination tool that takes a job expression, a JSON payload, an adaptor, and a configuration file, and runs the "TL" part of "ETL" on command. It can be run from a command line, or built into a hosted web service.

    #### language-common
    `language-common` provides basic data manipulation functionality like `each`, `field`, and `toArray`.

    #### language-xxx
    `language-xxx` is a "destination adaptor" that knows how to connect to the system in question and provides system-specific operations, like `relationship` or `upsert`. Examples: `language-dhis2`, `language-salesforce`, `language-openmrs`.

  3. cd into 'fn-lang'
  4. type into the terminal the following commands (in order):
    - npm install
    - npm link ../language-common
    - npm link ../language-xxx (Whatever adaptor you chose. For this demonstration we will use DHIS2)

  5. Create a folder named "tmp" inside "fn-lang".
  6. Inside "tmp", you need to create 3 files: `config.json`, `expression.js` and `message.json`.

  > Click [HERE](#sample-code-for-diy-section) to get started by using some sample code for each of the 3 files.

  7. Run fn-lang from the command line with the following:

  `~/fn-lang$ lib/cli.js execute -l dhis2 -e tmp/expression.js -c tmp/config.json -d tmp/message.json`

  **Command Explained:** Execute an expression (-e) and load on some data (-d) using a language-pack (-l) and a destination configuration file (-c).

  > **Note:** Depending on which language-pack you have decided to use, you will need to change this command by replacing "dhis2" with the name of the language-pack you are using. E.g. "openmrs" or "salesforce/FakeAdaptor" (special case).

  8. Check out the results of the posted data! Open up expression.js and message.json to manipulate the outcome and get a feel for how it works.


# Appendix

## Sample code for DIY section
Below you can find sample code to fill the 3 files required to run fn-lang - `message.json`, `expression.js` and `config.json`.

### message.json

    field("orgUnit", "DiszpKrYNg8"),
    field("eventDate", dataValue("properties.date")),
    field("status", "COMPLETED"),
    field("storedBy", "admin"),
    field("coordinate", {
      "latitude": "59.8",
      "longitude": "10.9"
    }),
    field("dataValues", function(state) {
      return [

        { "dataElement": "oZg33kd9taw", "value": dataValue("properties.prop_b")(state) },
        { "dataElement": "msodh3rEMJa", "value": dataValue("properties.prop_c")(state) }
      ]
    })

)
```

### config.json
```json
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "district",
  "apiUrl": "https://play.dhis2.org/demo"
}
```

## More example filters
### Match messages `WHERE` the `formId` is `"Robot_Photo_21.04.2015"`:
```json
{"formId":"Robot_Photo_21.04.2015"}
```

### Match a message `WHERE` this `AND` that are both included:
```json
{"formId":"Robot_Photo_21.04.2015", "secret_number":8}
```

### Match a message with two fragments inside an array called `data`:
(This is useful when gathering data via ODK)
```json
{"data":[{"outlet_call":"TRUE","new_existing":"Existing"}]}
```

### Match a message with a fragment inside another object called `form`:
```json
{"form":{"@xmlns":"http://openrosa.org/formdesigner/F732194-3278-nota-ReAL-one"}}
```

## More example jobs
Below you can find some examples of block code for different functions and data handling contexts.

#### Job expression (for CommCare to SF)
The following job expression will take a matching receipt and use data from that receipt to upsert a `Patient__c` record in Salesforce and create multiple new `Patient_Visit__c` (child to Patient) records.
```js
upsert("Patient__c", "Patient_Id__c", fields(
  field("Patient_Id__c", dataValue("form.patient_ID")),
  relationship("Nurse__r", "Nurse_ID_code__c", dataValue("form.staff_id")),
  field("Phone_Number__c", dataValue("form.mobile_phone"))
)),
each(
  join("$.data.form.visits[*]", "$.references[0].id", "Id"),
  create("Visit__c", fields(
    field("Patient__c", dataValue("Id")),
    field("Date__c", dataValue("date")),
    field("Reason__c", dataValue("why_did_they_see_doctor"))
  ))
)
```

#### Accessing the "data array" in Open Data Kit submissions
Notice how we use "each" to get data from each item inside the "data array" in ODK.
```js
each(
  "$.data.data[*]",
  create("ODK_Submission__c", fields(
    field("Site_School_ID_Number__c", dataValue("school")),
    field("Date_Completed__c", dataValue("date")),
    field("comments__c", dataValue("comments")),
    field("ODK_Key__c", dataValue("*meta-instance-id*"))
  ))
)
```

#### ODK to Salesforce: create parent record with many children from parent data
Here, the user brings `time_end` and `parentId` onto the line items from the parent object.

```js
each(
  dataPath("data[*]"),
  combine(
    create("transaction__c", fields(
      field("Transaction_Date__c", dataValue("today")),
      relationship("Person_Responsible__r", "Staff_ID_Code__c", dataValue("person_code")),
      field("metainstanceid__c", dataValue("*meta-instance-id*"))
    )),
    each(
      merge(dataPath("line_items[*]"), fields(
        field("end", dataValue("time_end")),
        field("parentId", lastReferenceValue("id"))
      )),
      create("line_item__c", fields(
        field("transaction__c", dataValue("parentId")),
        field("Barcode__c", dataValue("product_barcode")),
        field("ODK_Form_Completed__c", dataValue("end"))
      ))
    )
  )
)
```

> **NB - there was a known bug with the `combine` function which has been resolved. `combine` can be used to combine two operations into one and is commonly used to run multiple `create`'s inside an `each(path, operation)`. The source code for combine can be found here: [language-common: combine](https://github.com/OpenFn/language-common/blob/master/src/index.js#L204-L222)**

#### Create many child records WITHOUT a repeat group in ODK
```js
beta.each(
  "$.data.data[*]",
  upsert("Outlet__c", "Outlet_Code__c", fields(
    field("Outlet_Code__c", dataValue("outlet_code")),
    field("Location__Latitude__s", dataValue("gps:Latitude")),
    field("Location__Longitude__s", dataValue("gps:Longitude"))
  ))
),
beta.each(
    "$.data.data[*]",
    upsert("Outlet_Call__c", "Invoice_Number__c", fields(
      field("Invoice_Number__c", dataValue("invoice_number")),
      relationship("Outlet__r", "Outlet_Code__c", dataValue("outlet_code")),
      relationship("RecordType", "name", "No Call Card"),
      field("Trip__c", "a0FN0000008jPue"),
      relationship("Sales_Person__r", "Sales_Rep_Code__c", dataValue("sales_rep_code")),
      field("Date__c", dataValue("date")),
      field("Comments__c", dataValue("comments"))
  ))
)
```

#### Salesforce: Set record type using 'relationship(...)'
```js
create("custom_obj__c", fields(
            relationship("RecordType", "name", dataValue("submission_type"),
            field("name", dataValue("Name"))
            )
      ))
```


#### Salesforce: Set record type using record Type ID
```js
each(
  "$.data.data[*]",
  create("fancy_object__c", fields(
    field("RecordTypeId", "012110000008s19"),
    field("site_size", dataValue("size"))
  ))
)
```

#### Telerivet: Send SMS based on Salesforce workflow alert
```js
send(
  fields(
    field("to_number", dataValue("Envelope.Body.notifications.Notification.sObject.phone_number__c")),
    field("message_type", "sms"),
    field("route_id", ""),
    field("content", function(state) {
      return (
        "Hey there. Your name is ".concat(
          dataValue("Envelope.Body.notifications.Notification.sObject.name__c")(state),
          "."
        )
      )
    })
  )
)
```


#### Sample DHIS2 events API job:

    field("program", "eBAyeGv0exc"),
    field("orgUnit", "DiszpKrYNg8"),
    field("eventDate", dataValue("properties.date")),
    field("status", "COMPLETED"),
    field("storedBy", "admin"),
    field("coordinate", {
      "latitude": "59.8",

#### sample openMRS expression, creates a person and then a patient
```js
person(
  fields(
    field("gender", "F"),
    field("names", function(state) {
      return [{
        "givenName": dataValue("form.first_name")(state),
        "familyName": dataValue("form.last_name")(state)
      }]

```js
// Here, we make sure CommCare gives us an array to use in each(merge(...), ...)
alterState((state) => {
  const idCards = state.data.form.ID_cards_given_to_vendor;
  if (!Array.isArray(idCards)) {
    state.data.form.ID_cards_given_to_vendor = [idCards];
  }
  return state;
});

// Now state has been changed, and we carry on...
each(
  merge(dataPath("form.ID_cards_given_to_vendor[*]"), fields(
    field("Vendor_Id", dataValue("form.ID_vendor")),
    field("form_finished_time", dataValue("form.meta.timeEnd"))
  )),
  upsert("Small_Packet__c", "sp_id__c", fields(
     field("sp_id__c", dataValue("ID_cards_given_to_vendor")),
     relationship("Vendor__r", "Badge_Code__c", dataValue("Vendor_Id")),
     field("Small_Packet_Distribution_Date__c", dataValue("form_finished_time"))
  ))
);
```

## Examples of Anonymous Functions
Different to [Named Functions](#named-functions), Anoynmous functions are generic pieces of javascript which you can write to suit your needs. Here are some examples of these custom functions:

#### Custom replacer
```js
field(
  "destination__c",
  function(state){
    return dataValue("path_to_data")(state).toString().replace("cats","dogs")
  }
)
```
This will replace all "cats" with "dogs" in the string that lives at `path_to_data`.

> **NOTE:** The JavaScript `replace()` function only replaces the first instance of whatever argument you specify.
If you're looking for a way to replace all instances, we suggest you use a regex like we did in the [example](#custom-concatenation-of-null-values) below.

#### Custom arrayToString
```js
field("target_specie_list__c", function(state) {
  return Array.apply(
    null, sourceValue("$.data.target_specie_list")(state)
  ).join(', ')
}),
```
It will take an array, and concatenate each item into a string with a ", " separator.

#### Custom concatenation
```js
field("ODK_Key__c", function (state) {
  return (
    dataValue("metaId")(state).concat(
      "(", dataValue("index")(state), ")"
    )
  )
})
```
This will concatenate two values.

### Custom concatenation of null values
This will concatenate many values, even if one or more are null, writing them to a field called Main_Office_City_c.

```js
...
  field("Main_Office_City__c", function(state) {
    return arrayToString([
      dataValue("Main_Office_City_a")(state) === null ? "" : dataValue("Main_Office_City_a")(state).toString().replace(/-/g, " "),
      dataValue("Main_Office_City_b")(state) === null ? "" : dataValue("Main_Office_City_b")(state).toString().replace(/-/g, " "),
      dataValue("Main_Office_City_c")(state) === null ? "" : dataValue("Main_Office_City_c")(state).toString().replace(/-/g, " "),
      dataValue("Main_Office_City_d")(state) === null ? "" : dataValue("Main_Office_City_d")(state).toString().replace(/-/g, " "),

> Notice how this custom function makes use of the **regex** `/-/g` to ensure that all instances are accounted for (g = global search).

#### Custom Nth reference ID
If you ever want to retrieve the FIRST object you created, or the SECOND, or the Nth, for that matter, a function like this will do the trick.

```js
field("parent__c", function(state) {
    return state.references[state.references.length-1].id
  })
```
See how instead of taking the id of the "last" thing that was created in Salesforce, you're taking the id of the 1st thing, or 2nd thing if you replace "length-1" with "length-2".

#### Convert date string to standard ISO date for Salesforce
```js
field("Payment_Date__c", function(state) {
  return new Date(dataValue("payment_date")(state)).toISOString()
})
```
> **NOTE**: The output of this function will always be formatted according to GMT time-zone.
