## App Overview
CKAN (Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network) is the world’s leading open-source data portal platform. CKAN makes it easy to publish, share and work with data. It's a data management system that provides a powerful platform for cataloging, storing and accessing datasets with a rich front-end, full API (for both data and catalog), visualization tools and more.

CKAN is a tool for making open data websites. It helps you manage and publish collections of data. It is used by national and local governments, research institutions, and other organizations who collect a lot of data. See the public documentation for more:

### Helpful Features & Plug-ins
See [https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/extensions/index.html](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/extensions/index.html)

Helpful features include:
1. The CKAN DataStore extension provides an ad hoc database for storage of structured data from CKAN resources.
2. Advanced geospatial features, covering data preview, search, and discovery.
3. An intuitive web interface that allows you to easily register, update and refine datasets.
4. Completely customizable with themes to match your brand. 
5. Creation of a federated network of data portals which share data between each other.
6. Rich search experience which allows for quick ‘Google-style’ keyword search and filtering.
7. Create data-visualisation views and expose data as line, bar and pie charts.
8. Upload media and image files. Stores files either on the server or in the cloud using extensions.
9. CKAN allows you to pick and choose which features you want to use for your data portal. Or, you can easily develop your own by following the extending guide!


## Integration Use Cases
CKAN has been adopted by enterprise organisations in sectors such as resources, energy, pharmaceuticals and finance to publish and manage internal data assets. In addition, CKAN is widely used, mainly in the field of open government data, where it has become a de facto standard software package. CKAN powers the national open data portals of the UK, the USA, Australia or the EU, to name only a few well-known examples.

Using the API you can do things like:

- Access any bit of information in CKAN (if you are authorized!)
- Edit any piece of information in CKAN
- Create a whole new web front-end for CKAN (if you want!)

> Tags: geospatial

> As a User I want to Be able to generate visualizations/graphs from the data that I can then save or download so that I can use a graph representing the data for my work
quickly
> Tags: vis

> As a User I want to See that a resource was derived from another resource (or resources) and see reference to code/sql/etc that underlay this transformation so that I know that this resource was built from something else
> Tags: storage-and-processing

>As a Data Wrangler I want to Write some javascript to convert my csv file to another structure and preview a sample of running this in my browser and then save this to run on the whole file with the result saved in a new dataset (resource) so that ...
> Tags: webstore

> As a Data wrangler I want to Having created a data file derived from an existing file I want to upload it to a new, named location and document both the relation and the steps performed to create the change. so that I (and others) can easily find my material and see what steps when into creating it.
> Tags: webstore

> As a Publisher I want to create relationships between datasets (e.g. dataset X is derived from dataset Y, inherits from dataset Z) so that I can see how datasets relate to each other

## APIs & Integration Options
The APIs available depend on the CKAN version you're using. See API docs: https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/api/index.html

All of a CKAN website’s core functionality (everything you can do with the web interface and more) can be used by external code that calls the CKAN API. The CKAN API follows the RESTful (Representational State Transfer) style and uses JSON by default.

For example, using the CKAN API your app can:

- Get JSON-formatted lists of a site’s datasets, groups or other CKAN objects: http://demo.ckan.org/api/3/action/package_list
- Get a full JSON representation of a dataset, resource or other object: http://demo.ckan.org/api/3/action/package_show?id=adur_district_spending
- Search for packages or resources matching a query: http://demo.ckan.org/api/3/action/package_search?q=spending
- Create, update and delete datasets, resources and other objects
- Get an activity stream of recently changed datasets on a site: http://demo.ckan.org/api/3/action/recently_changed_packages_activity_list

Beyond using OpenFn to connect with the API, you can access the API using one the dedicated tools or libraries written specifically for CKAN. The following clients are available:

- dpm (data package manager): command-line client and Python library (maintained by core CKAN team)
- ckanclient - CKAN Python Client: Python client maintained by the core CKAN team
- CKAN Ruby: Ruby Client
- Ckan_client-PHP: PHP client
- Ckan_client-J: Java client
- net-ckan: PERL client
- ckanjs: sophisticated Javascript client built on Backbone.
- Google Refine CKAN Extension: Google Refine client which allows you to get and push data to and from a CKAN instance using Google Refine.


## Webhook/webservice for CKAN

See documentation on:
- ckanext-webhooks: https://github.com/datacats/ckanext-webhooks
- ckanext-geopusher : https://github.com/datacats/ckanext-geopusher

## Getting Started with CKAN
CKAN offers robust, public documentation. See the [CKAN User Guide](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/user-guide.html).  

### API Notes
CKAN exposes all core features to its API. See the API guide: [https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/api/](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/api/)

CKAN’s `FileStore` and `DataStore` have their own APIs, see:
- FileStore and file uploads: https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/maintaining/filestore.html
- DataStore extension: https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/maintaining/datastore.html

Note that some API functions require authorization. The API uses the same authorization functions and configuration as the web interface, so if a user is authorized to do something in the web interface they’ll be authorized to do it via the API as well.

To call the CKAN API, post a JSON dictionary in an HTTP POST request to one of CKAN’s API URLs. The parameters for the API function should be given in the JSON dictionary. CKAN will also return its response in a JSON dictionary.

One way to post a JSON dictionary to a URL is using the command-line client Curl. For example, to get a list of the names of all the datasets in the data-explorer group on demo.ckan.org, install curl and then call the group_list API function by running this command in a terminal:

    `curl https://demo.ckan.org/api/3/action/group_list`

The response from CKAN will look like this:

   ```
   {
     "help": "...",
     "result": [
         "data-explorer",
         "department-of-ricky",
         "geo-examples",
         "geothermal-data",
         "reykjavik",
         "skeenawild-conservation-trust"
     ],
     "success": true
    }
   ``` 
#### JSONP support
To cater for scripts from other sites that wish to access the API, the data can be returned in JSONP format, where the JSON data is ‘padded’ with a function call. The function is named in the ‘callback’ parameter. For example:

http://demo.ckan.org/api/3/action/package_show?id=adur_district_spending&callback=myfunction

CKAN's source code can be found at github.

Example normal request:

    `GET /api/rest/dataset/pollution_stats`
    `returns: {"name": "pollution_stats", ... }`

but now with the callback parameter:

    `GET /api/rest/dataset/pollution_stats?callback=name-of-callback-function`
    `returns: jsoncallback({"name": "pollution_stats", ... });`
    
This parameter can apply to all POST requests to the Action API and GET requests to the Search API and v1/v2/v3 APIs.
    
### App Installation
See the [System Admin guide](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/sysadmin-guide.html). 

- To install CKAN see: https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/maintaining/installing/index.html?highlight=install%20CKAN
- To upgrade CKAN see: https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/maintaining/upgrading/index.html?highlight=configure%20CKAN

    To provide your API token in an HTTP request, include it in either an Authorization or X-CKAN-API-Key header. (The name of the HTTP header can be configured with the apikey_header_name option in your CKAN configuration file.)


## OpenFn Adaptor
Currently no CKAN-specific adaptor exists, but [language-http](https://www.github.com/openfn/language-http) can be implemented to access the web API. 


## Implementation Examples

CKAN has been implemented in [catalog.data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov), [open.canada.ca/data](https://open.canada.ca/data), and [data.humdata.org](https://data.humdata.org).
