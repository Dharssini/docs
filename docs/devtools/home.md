A set of tools for writing &amp; testing expressions, managing OpenFn projects,
and developing new adaptors.

```

## Up and running

1. Make sure you've got [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (maybe GitBash for
   Windows?)
2. And [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version 12 or greater)
3. Run `git clone git@github.com:OpenFn/devtools.git` for SSH or
   `git clone https://github.com/OpenFn/devtools.git`
4. Run `cd devtools`
5. Run `./install.sh ssh` or `./install.sh https` to install core,
   language-common, and language-http

_Note: If you get a "permission denied" message when running `./install.sh`, try
`run chmod +x ./install.sh ` then retry the install command._

To install specific adaptors, run
`./install.sh ${ssh || https} language-${name}`

When you install a new adaptor, the latest version will be enabled by default.
To switch the adaptor version when running jobs locally, in the root of the
adaptor directory, run:

`git checkout tags/v2.4.15` (substitute `2.4.15` with the adaptor version you
want)

You can run core from anywhere by using `npm install -g @openfn/core` for a
global install.

## Usage

Execute takes:

1. `-l [language-package].Adaptor`: The adaptor being used
2. `-e [expression.js]:` The expression being tested
3. `-s [state.json]`: The message `data: {...}` and credential
   `configuration: {...}`
4. `-o [output.json]`: The file to which the output will be written

### Bash usage

```sh
~/devtools/core/bin/core execute \
  -l ~/devtools/adaptors/language-http \
  -s ./tmp/state.json \
  -o ./tmp/output.json \
  -e ./tmp/expression.js
```

### The `--test` option

```sh
~/devtools/core/bin/core execute \
  -l ~/devtools/adaptors/language-http \
  -s ./tmp/state.json \
  -o ./tmp/output.json \
  -e ./tmp/expression.js \
  --test
```

This intercepts all HTTP requests and displays the request information for
debugging.

#### `.FakeAdaptor`

Adaptors may provide dummy modules for testing. `language-salesforce` has a
built-in `.FakeAdaptor` which allows a user to test expressions on data without
sending them to a real Salesforce server.

Instead of using `-l ./language-salesforce.Adaptor`, use
`-l./language-salesforce.FakeAdaptor` to test expressions offline:
`./core/bin/core execute -l ./language-salesforce.FakeAdaptor -s ./tmp/state.json -o ./tmp/output.json -e ./tmp/expression.js`

#### Offline testing for other adaptors

For most standard adaptors which make use of HTTP requests, you can add `--test`
to the execute command to intercept all HTTP requests and return a `200`.

## Configure an OpenFn project

You can use YAML project configuration files to define projects both on the
[OpenFn platform](/documentation/deploy/platform) and in
[OpenFn microservice](https://openfn.github.io/microservice/readme.html#content).
Running `./scripts/generate-project.js` helps you build a project config YAML
interactively, adding your triggers, credentials and jobs to the config. You can
read more about the config file
[here](https://openfn.github.io/microservice/readme.html#sample-configuration)

If you choose `monolith` mode, all your job code will be included in the YAML.
In `URI` mode, youâ€™ll get a config file with URI-s to your defined jobs.

## Pre-Requisites

1. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is required to run jobs and use many
   of the scripts in Devtools.

2. [Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is used so that our modern (es9)
   JavaScript can be run on older Node runtimes. To install it and other build
   tools, you might run `sudo apt-get install build-essential`.

3. A basic working knowledge of NodeJs, promises and asynchronous functions is
   essential for writing adaptors.

## Scripts

Devtools comes with a collection of scripts to aid in setting up a development
environment for adaptor work, and include commands to quickly clone a large
number of adaptors, create tarballs of adaptors with only production
dependencies included, etc.

For the kitchen sink, run:

```sh
./install ssh
./scripts/bootstrap npm-install
```

In order to run the scripts, ensure you have cd'd into the project directory and
enter `./scripts/<script-name>`

### bootstrap

Installs all adaptors in `repos` file to the `/adaptors` directory and prepares
the working directory. This needs to be run before running any of the other
scripts. Pass `npm-install` to run npm install for each adaptor also.

`./scripts/bootstrap npm-install` - to clone, set up hooks and npm install in
each `./scripts/bootstrap`- to clone and set up hooks in each

### generate-project.js

`./scripts/generate-project.js` interactively generates a YAML project
configuration file that can be used both on the OpenFn platform and in OpenFn
microservice to define projects.

### generate-doclets

Iterates overs all language pack folder names found in the `repos` list and
creates a doclet json file in the `doclets` directory.

### analyse-doclets

Iterates overs all doclets found in `doclets` and gives a tree view of the
doclet structure using [jsdoc-query](https://github.com/OpenFn/jsdoc-query).

## Building adaptors for platform

As of now, all new adaptor releases are done through `docker container`. The importance of running the release process through container is to have a similar environment accross the team for deploying. Inside the container, openfn dev team, have the same setup and dependencies are pre-installed. Whether you build using a laptop under Windows, MacOS or Linux you are committed to the same characteristics as the others.

Below is the process:

1. Reopen your package in **dev-container** by typing `ctrl+shift+p (cmd+shift+p for mac)`
   and choosing **Remote-Container: Rebuild and Reopen in Container**.
2. After the build is finished, open a terminal in vscode and run **`openfn-devtools release .`**. This creates the tag and pushes to npm.
3. Run **`openfn-devtools package-release .`** to package everything with
   production dependencies.

For each of those steps (2 and 3), you might encounter issues preventing the
command to run correctly.

## Troubleshooting VSCode containerized development
Following are the potential issues to encounter. Those issues are mostly present when your local environment differs from the default setup. The containerized vscode environment might not have
default access to your local setup variables and then need customization.
### Issue with git config

An issue can pop up about git config not set, To solve this, you should set your
email and name globally using the commands below:

      git config --global user.email "youremail@something.com"
      git config --global user.name "Your Name"

### Issue on ssh public key

Another issue you can face is accessing your local ssh public key inside the
container.

:::warning Error: permission denied (publickey)
:::warning

To solve this, first make sure the `ssh agent` is [up and running](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_sharing-git-credentials-with-your-container). In MacOS, it is running by default.
:::tip Linux
Start the agent using the command

      eval "$(ssh-agent -s)".
Then you can add these line your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zprofile` (for Zsh) to make it running by default.

      if [ -z "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ]; then
         RUNNING_AGENT="`ps -ax | grep 'ssh-agent -s' | grep -v grep | wc -l | tr -d '[:space:]'`"
         if [ "$RUNNING_AGENT" = "0" ]; then
            # Launch a new instance of the agent
            ssh-agent -s &> $HOME/.ssh/ssh-agent
         fi
         eval `cat $HOME/.ssh/ssh-agent`
      fi
:::tip

Second step to this, would be to configure your `vscode`, in such a way that it is
accessing your local env variables.

In VSCode, go to `Settings`, and in the search bar, type
`terminal.integrated.inherit`. You should see the option in the image below and
check it if it's unchecked.

![vscode settings](/img/vscode-settings.png)

Last step in this process, is to run the command below to add your identity to the ssh
agent:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs
  defaultValue="linux"
  values={[
    { label: 'Linux', value: 'linux' },
    { label: 'MacOS', value: 'macos' },
  ]}
>
   <TabItem value="linux">

      ssh-add <path-to-your-ssh-file>

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="macos">

      ssh-add -A

   </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Issue with Github Token (GH_TOKEN)
Make sure you set up an [access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) in Github.

In your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` file, export the newly created token by adding this line

      #GITHUB TOKEN
      export GH_TOKEN=<TOKEN>

Following those steps, feel free to re-running the `release` and `package-release` commands to finally release your new adaptor.

## Using a new adaptor in an OpenFn/platform instance

1. Add your release to the `scripts/install-lp` script.
2. Add the version number to `priv/adaptors.json`.
3. Add the `bodySchema` to `CredentialView.js`.
