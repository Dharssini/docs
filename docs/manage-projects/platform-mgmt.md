## What is a Project?

A Project on OpenFn is a shared workspace for a team or organization that contains their Workflows, Credentials and Collaborators scoped to that project.

You can access your Project's information under Settings. Setup allows you to view or edit the project name and description.

You can also export your entire project "as code" - either to save it, or to edit your project locally. You can learn more about this feature on our Portability page. (https://docs.openfn.org/documentation/next/deploy/portability)
