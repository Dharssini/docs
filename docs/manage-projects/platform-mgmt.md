## What is a Project?

A `Project` on OpenFn is a shared workspace for a team or organization that contains their Workflows, Credentials and Collaborators scoped to that project.

## Updating Project Information

You can access your Project's information under `Settings` (see app menu sidebar). Setup allows you to view or edit the project name and description.

You can also export your entire project "as code" - either to save it, or to edit your project locally. You can learn more about this feature on our [Portability page](/documentation/next/deploy/portability).
