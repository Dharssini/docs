## Managing Credentials

You can view the credentials related to a project under Project Settings - Credentials page. It contains the name, type, owner the credentials, and whether it's for a production environment. All project collaborators can view these details. 

To add a new credential, click on the New Credential button, and choose the type of system you want to connect to. If it's not listed, choose "Raw JSON".
