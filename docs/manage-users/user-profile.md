### Enable Multi-Factor Authentication

By enabling Multi-Factor Authentication, you can add an additional layer of
security to your account by requiring more than just a password for logging in.

You can link your account to an authenticator app or a browser extension like
1Password or Authy. Once configured, the app will generate a one-time password
for you to provide during sign-in to verify your identity at each login.

To configure multi-factor authentication, use an authenticator app or browser
extension to scan the QR code found on your profile.

Alternatively, you can provide the secret key generated on your profile to the
app to set it up.

### Account Deletion

Your User Profile is also the place where you can delete your OpenFn account.
