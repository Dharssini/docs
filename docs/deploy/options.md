title: Planning for Deployment

OpenFn/platform (the iPaaS), OpenFn/core, OpenFn/engine, and more than 50 open-source adaptors maintained by OpenFn can be used locally or on the cloud, and as stand-alone solutions or as modules in other applications. Together the interoperability suite provides organizations with the tools they need to connect with any application or database, adhere to any data standards, and automate any rote digital process. The tools themselves range from lightweight NodeJS apps to robust and highly-fault-tolerant enterprise applications running on the ErlangVM. They are typically used in their hosted forms on the cloud or deployed with Docker and/or Kubernetes.
