We're still in the process of migrating the docs for devtools over here.

## Introduction

When organizations or governments have an open-source license requirement, all
jobs, credentials, and project configurations can be exported from OpenFn's
iPaaS and used to create a microservice deployment using OpenFn's FOSS ETL
tools.

This approach does not offer most OpenFn platform features, but ensures that
existing investment in an OpenFn setup can be used in the creation of a
completely FOSS alternative.

This microservice approach provides flexibility to governments and NGOs, so they
are never locked-in to OpenFn's SaaS platform offering, and can port their
existing jobs, triggers, and credentials from OpenFn.org to their own
infrastructure easily.

## Prerequisites

Familiarity with other elements of OpenFn's open source integration toolkit is
helpful when considering the microservice appraoch.
