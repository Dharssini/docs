### ***What is OpenFn?***

OpenFn is an ***integration platform as a service***. This means our prime
directive is to move data quickly and securely between different software
systems. In most cases:

1. A source application sends **messages** to your project’s **inbox** when
something happens.

2. **Jobs** will be triggered, based on your **filters**, and use the data in
those messages to attempt specific actions in destination systems.

3. The **logs** are recorded so you can see precisely what happened and when and
where it happened to take action in the event of a failed attempt—like editing
the job or even the source message and trying it again.

### ***Who uses OpenFn?***

OpenFn is used by organizations big and small, but the individuals interacting
with the platform range from system administrators to Javascript developers.
With a basic understanding of Javascript, the flexibility of the platform is
almost limitless.

### ***Is OpenFn open-source?***

OpenFn has built and maintains dozens of open-source data transformation and API
wrapper software packages. They are licensed under the **LGPL** and can be used
freely to extract, transform, and load data from a command line, or as part of
another software application.

OpenFn also hosts a proprietary web-application that ties these tools together
(www.openfn.org) into an out-of-the-box integration management platform.

### ***How reliable is the hosted service?***

OpenFn has harnessed the extreme stability and scalability of Erlang to
coordinate these actions and provide users with email alerts, project management
tools, and an online job writing IDE.
