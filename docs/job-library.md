title: Job Library
---

There have been over 3,000 distinct jobs written with OpenFn, and they provide
the best way for newcomers to learn how to use the platform.

We're currently designing a "job library" which organizations can opt into,
which would share all their job expressions (without exposing source data, of
course) for the benefit of the broader community.

While we get this all together, please browse some of our client's open-source
jobs on the OpenFn [Github page](https://www.github.com/openfn) and check out a
few extra samples [here](https://github.com/OpenFn/docs/tree/master/job-library).

As always, please feel free to submit your own private jobs as a pull request if
you think they'd help others.
