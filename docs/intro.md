## What's OpenFn?

OpenFn is a suite of data integration, interoperability, and business process
automation (i.e., workflow) tools that's used by governments, NGOs, and social
enterprises, primarily in the health and humanitarian sectors. It includes both

- the [**OpenFn platform**](https://www.openfn.org) (an
  _integration-platform-as-a-service_ or "iPaaS") and
- the free and open-source
  [**OpenFn Integration Toolkit**](/documentation/getting-started/integration-toolkit),

with the latter being a **digital public good** (a "DPG") recognized in Digital
Square's
[Global Goods Guidebook](https://digitalsquare.org/resourcesrepository/global-goods-guidebook).

In essence, OpenFn is software that makes it easier for governments and NGOs to
_connect_ the different technologies they use, share data securely, drive
critical business processes, and scale their interventions via automated
interoperability.

## We ❤️ documentation.

This site is the one-stop-shop documentation site for the whole suite of OpenFn
data integration, interoperability, and automation tools. Here you will learn
how to use OpenFn to build automation workflows that can be as short and simple
or as long and complex as you like. You also will learn about all of the ways
you can choose to deploy the automation flows you create.

Check out the sections on the left. They'll show you how to get up and running,
as well as how to design, build, deploy, and manage data integration and
interoperability projects using OpenFn technologies and beyond.

Please feel free to point out [issues](https://github.com/openfn/docs/issues)
with this documentation or, if you can't find the right repo, issues with the
tools themselves. (The more feedback the better!). If you want to propose some
new language for the documentation, you can make those changes by clicking the
**"Edit this page"** link at the bottom of any page and submit a pull request!

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to email
[admin@openfn.org](mailto:admin@openfn.org).

:::note

Note that some technical documentation and source code for OpenFn's FOSS
integration tools and adaptors can also be found in their respective
repositories at [Github.com/OpenFn](https://github.com/openfn) or see
[Deploy](https://docs.openfn.org/documentation/deploy/options) section for an
overview of the FOSS options and additional docs.
