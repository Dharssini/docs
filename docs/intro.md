## OpenFn.org and OpenFn/Core Documentation

This documentation is for [OpenFn.org](https://www.openfn.org), and is primarily
intended to help users of the site. Technical documentation for OpenFn's
open-source integration tools and language-packs can be found in their
respective repositories at [Github.com/OpenFn](https://github.com/openfn).

Check out the tabs at the top of the page. They'll take you to documentation
about [the Platform](platform.md), [job writing](jobs/core.md) (for both hosted
and locally-deployed/open-source version of OpenFn), and connecting
[source applications](source-apps.md) so you can publish data to OpenFn in real
time.

If you want a new feature or find a bug, please
[submit an issue](https://github.com/openfn/docs/issues). If you find an issue
with the documentation or want to share your custom functions, you can make
those changes yourself and
[submit a pull request](https://github.com/OpenFn/docs/compare)!

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to email
[admin@openfn.org](mailto:admin@openfn.org).
