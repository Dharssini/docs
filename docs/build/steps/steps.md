title: Introduction to Steps
---

A Step is a specific task or activity in a workflow. In OpenFn Workflows, each
Step is linked to an [Adaptor](/adaptors/) and contains business logic to
perform a specific task or operation in that target app.

## The anatomy of a Step

- `Name` - A human-readable name describing the Step and its purpose.
- `Adaptor` - The selected Adaptor that is used to provide app-specific
  functionality for this Step (e.g., `dhis2` or `commcare`)
- `Adaptor Version` - The version of the selected Adaptor, which determines
  which API endpoints and Adaptor functions are available
- `Credentials` - The Credential used to authorize connections to the target app
  related to this Step.
- `Expression` - The step "script" or `Job expression` that defines the business
  logic and/or sequence of operations to be executed

## Step Inputs and Outputs

Every Step has an initial state (which may contain an Input) and results in a
final state that will include Logs and an Output.

- `Input` - Data (JSON) that is used as the starting Input for a Step to utilise
  in its run. An Input can exist for a Work Order and individual Steps within a
  Run, though it is possible for either to exist without an Input.
- `Output` - Data (JSON) that is created as the Output of a Step's execution. An
  Output can exist for a Work Order and individual jobs within a run, and
  typically contains the data sent to the target app.
- `Logs` - A record generated by the workflow execution engine that details the
  activities performed when running a Workflow or individual Step.

## Adaptors

We've got a whole section on creating new [Adaptors](/adaptors), but the
critical thing to be aware of when writing a step is that you've got to choose
an **adaptor**, and an **adaptor version**.

All of the discussion below of helper functions like `create` or `findPatient`
requires some understanding of adaptors. When you run a step, you're borrowing a
layer of functionality that's been built to connect with some specific API, type
of API, or database.

For example, `create` means one thing in `language-salesforce` and another thing
entirely in `language-dhis2`. For this reason, before you can begin writing a
step you have to decide which `adaptor` to work with.

### Adaptor Versions

Adaptors change over time. They're open source, and we encourage as much
contribution as possible—releasing new versions for use on OpenFn.org as soon as
they pass our security reviews. New features may be added and bugs may be fixed,
but in order to make sure that an existing integration is not broken, we
recommend that you select a specific version (rather than using the
"auto-upgrade" feature) when you choose an adaptor. The highest released version
is the default choice here.

:::tip

The _first 4 lines_ in the log of any run on OpenFn will tell you what adaptor
you're running. (As well as the version of worker, engine and NodeJs) This is
incredibly important, particularly if you're trying to troubleshoot steps in
various environments (like your own shell, app.openfn.org etc.).

:::

Pay careful attention to which `version` you're using to write a step. Consider
the following run logs:

```sh
Versions for run f470a3da-8b90-480e-a94f-6dd982c91afe:
    ▸ node.js                     18.19.0
    ▸ worker                      0.5.0
    ▸ engine                      0.2.6
    ▸ @openfn/language-primero    2.9.1
...more logs here...
```

### Managing Adaptor Versions

While it may be beneficial to upgrade as part of your routine maintenance, these
upgrades should be carefully tested. Most often, customers upgrade to a new
adaptor version for an existing step when they are making business-drives
changes to that step. Some business-driven changes may actually _require_
upgrading the version in order to use a new feature from the adaptor. Even if
those changes don't require and upgrade, if the technical team must spend time
testing step-specific changes anyway, it may be an ideal opportunity to test
also test an upgrade.

Adaptors follow [SEMVER](https://semver.org/) so you can be reasonably assured
that upgrading from `x.1.z` to `x.2.z` will not lead to existing step code
failing, but an upgrade from `3.y.z` to `4.y.z` may—in SEMVER _major_ upgrades
(those that change the first number in the `x.y.z` version number) have
"breaking" or "non-backwards compatible" changes.

:::tip

When you configure a Step, you can select a specific `Adaptor Version` to
version-lock your Step. Avoid selecting `latest` for Adaptor Version, if you
want this and to avoid the risk of accidental upgrades on live Workflows.
