Use the "Inspector" interface on the platform to create, edit, and test Steps.
(If you built your Workflow locally using the CLI, you can edit your Jobs on the
app via this interface.)

To access this interface:

1. Open a Workflow
2. Select a Step you want to edit or test
3. Click the code button `</>` displayed on the configuration panel

For more on how to write custom business logic and data transformation rules in
the `Editor`, see the docs on
[writing Job expressions](/docs/build/steps/job-expressions.md).
