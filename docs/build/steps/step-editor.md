The inspector interface allows a user to create, modify and test business logic
for the connected Adaptor that is associated to the Step. It's accessed through
the "code" button displayed on the on the Step configuration panel which is
shown when a Step is selected.

## Step Inspector Features

When editing a step, you can find messages in the inbox that match your step
trigger by clicking "Find messages matching this trigger". If you navigate to a
field within the message JSON, you can copy the exact path to the field and
paste it as a `dataValue` in your step.

You can find a list of avaible helper functions for your chosen adaptor in the
step writing panel heading. Clicking the function name copies the function code
that you can directly paste into the step.
