## Run & Test Steps

When running Steps to test the configuration, every Run will have an initial
state (which may contain an `Input`) and results in a final state that will
include `Logs` and an `Output`.

- `Input` - Data (JSON) that is used as the starting Input for a Step to utilise
  in its run. An Input can exist for a Work Order and individual Steps within a
  Run, though it is possible for either to exist without an Input.
- `Output` - Data (JSON) that is created as the Output of a Step's execution. An
  Output can exist for a Work Order and individual jobs within a run, and
  typically contains the data sent to the target app.
- `Logs` - A record generated by the workflow execution engine that details the
  activities performed when running a Workflow or individual Step.

See [Edit Steps](/docs/build/steps/step-editor.md) for more on making changes
and testing, and see [this article](/docs/build/steps/state.md) for more on the
concept of "state" when writing Jobs and building OpenFn Workflows.
