A [Run](/documentation/next/get-started/terminology#run) is created each time
OpenFn attempts to excute a Workflow for a given Work Order. All Runs can be
viewed, filtered, and searched via the `History` page.

In short, Runs tell us "what happened" when OpenFn tried to execute the
Workflow. Runs have start times, end times, logs, and
[status codes](/documentation/next/monitor-history/status-codes) that indicate
when they took place, what they did, and whether or not they succeeded.

Check out the below video tutorial
([or see link](https://youtu.be/xPgVZmJMT3w?si=bMf9wof_Qla-0ihW)) for a walk
through on inspecting Runs via the History page.
