## Work Order Status

A work order (e.g., "complete the referral workflow for patient 123") is the
typically the unit of business value for an organization.

Because administrators may want to attempt the same work order multiple times
(e.g., "try to complete the referral workflow for patient 123 again now that the
government case management system is back online") the "status" of a work order
is determined by the status of the _last_ run for that work order.

I.e., if the "complete the referral workflow for patient 123" work order has
been run twice and the first one failed but the second attempt succeeded, the
"status" for that work order will be "success".

## Run Status

Every run has a status which indicates whether it completed successfully.

### \*Note on error handling within a workflow

Note that if a step fails (e.g., `JobError`, `TypeError`, `RangeError`) the
worker will continue processing the workflow as there may be error handling
rules in downstream edges. (E.g., "If step 3 fails, execute step 4.")

If a step fails with a crash (e.g., `Syntax Error`) the worker won't be able to
execute any downstream logic and the whole attempt will be aborted.
