### Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the @openfn/cli, an essential tool designed for
running workflows locally. It streamlines the execution, building, and testing
of OpenFn workflows for developers.

### Overview

This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to the
[@openfn/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfn/cli), replacing the
deprecated [@openfn/devtools](https://github.com/OpenFn/devtools). It introduces
new features, including:

- A new runtime and compiler for executing and creating OpenFn jobs.
- Customizable logging output for enhanced visibility.
- Automatic installation of language adaptors.
- Support for the adaptors monorepo (@openfn/adaptors).

### Before You Start

Before you begin with the @openfn/cli, make sure to follow these simple steps:

1. **Code Editor:** Ensure you have a code editor installed on your machine. You
   can use popular editors like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or
   [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
2. **Node.js Installation:** Install Node.js (version 18 or later): - For Linux,
   Windows, or macOS, use a version manager like
   [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or
   [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html). -
   [Install Node.js](https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-install-node-js/) by
   following this guide.
3. **Understand OpenFn Basics:** Have a basic understanding of OpenFn,
   particularly jobs and adaptors. Check out the
   [Intro section](/documentation/next) on this site.
