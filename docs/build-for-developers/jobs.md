title: Jobs
---

Jobs define the specific series of "operations" (think: tasks or database actions) to be performed in an individual Workflow Step. See the [Steps section](/docs/build/steps/steps.md) for detailed documentation and tips for [writing Job expressions](/docs/build/steps/job-expressions.md). 

:::note

In OpenFn V1, there was no concept of `Workflow Steps`--they were referred to as `Jobs`. In V2, we now refer to Jobs as the "job expressions" or "script" that define the business logic and transformation rules of individual `Steps`.
