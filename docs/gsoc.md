title: Google Summer of Code

## Overview

OpenFn provides data integration, automation, and interoperability tools that
are used to scale the world's most promising health and humanitarian
interventions. UNICEF, the World Health Organization, the IRC, and the Wildlife
Conservation Society are just a few of the many organizations that drive
efficiency via OpenFn software. With an open-core model, we've got hosted and
locally-deployed solutions in 40+ countries, and this summer you'll get the
chance to work on leading-edge ETL tools built in Elixir/Erlang, and NodeJs. If
learning about APIs, data transformation, and middleware/automation layers
excites you, OpenFn is the place to be.

## Project Ideas

### OpenFn/microservice Extension

You'll be working in [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/),
[`Phoenix`](https://www.phoenixframework.org/),
[`Elixir`](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [`Erlang`](https://www.erlang.org/).

### OpenFn/engine Extension

You'll be working in [`Elixir`](https://elixir-lang.org/) and
[`Erlang`](https://www.erlang.org/).

### OpenFn/core Metrics

You'll be working in [`NodeJs`](https://nodejs.dev/learn) and
[`Typescript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Adaptors 2.0

Adaptors are the API wrappers that allow OpenFn users to quickly and easily work
with the most common APIs in international development. They provide an
interface for connecting to DHIS2, ODK, CommCare, OpenMRS, etc., etc.

They're NodeJs modules, but in order to make the adaptor development and _use_
process better, we want to bring them into the future with Typescript. Adaptors
should tell you how to use them while you use them.

You'll be working in [`NodeJs`](https://nodejs.dev/learn) and
[`Typescript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
