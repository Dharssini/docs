:::tip Automation, integration, & interoperability

OpenFn is open source software that makes it easier for governments and NGOs to
_connect_ the different technologies they use, automate critical business
processes, and scale their interventions. OpenFn enables automation,
integration, and data interoperability for the worlds most impactful
organizations.

:::

## What is OpenFn?

**OpenFn is the leading
[Digital Public Good](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/digital-public-goods/) for
workflow automation**–a platform that's been used by 70+ NGOs and government
ministries to automate and integrate critical business processes and information
systems.

**Connect any app** with OpenFn's library of open-source [Adaptors](/adaptors/)
(i.e., connectors). From last-mile services to national-level reporting, OpenFn
boosts efficiency & effectiveness while enabling secure, stable, scalable
interoperability at all levels.

OpenFn can be deployed locally or on the secure
[cloud-hosted platform](https://openfn.org/pricing). See the
[Deploy docs](/documentation/deploy/options) for more on deployment options
and requirements.

To support implementers, OpenFn has an online
[community](https://community.openfn.org), documentation, and
[support](mailto://support@openfn.org). Contact
[partnerships@openfn.org](mailto://partnerships@openfn.org) to learn about
OpenFn implementation partners and the OpenFn Partner Program.

### OpenFn v2: Lightning ⚡

When you hear "OpenFn", think
[OpenFn/lightning](https://github.com/OpenFn/lightning/)--**the OpenFn "v2"**.
It is a _full open source_ workflow automation web application which can be
deployed and run anywhere. It is designed for governments and NGOs who want
state-of-the-art workflow automation and data integration/interoperability
capabilities with fully-fledged user management and auditing capabilities
through a managed _or_ entirely self-hosted platform.

The v2 leverages the same tried-and-trusted core technology as the OpenFn v1 and
comes with an improved, visual interface for building integrations.

:::info OpenFn v2 replaces the v1

OpenFn v2 is available to any new users. All organizations currently using the
legacy OpenFn v1 platform will be migrated to OpenFn v2 by the end of 2024.

:::

### OpenFn v1

OpenFn v1 is the legacy OpenFn _integration-platform-as-a-service_ or "iPaaS"
first launched in 2015. OpenFn v1 was open-core with a proprietary web app.

The v1 platform will be sunsetted by 2025 and replaced by the fully open-source
OpenFn v2 (see above).
