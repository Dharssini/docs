We are all staring at a concrete block. We are hot, a little bewildered, deeply
impressed.

Enouce just laughs (he does that a lot) and leads us up a flight of unfinished
stairs, all rough concrete and exposed metal.

It's light and airy, the last drips of summer sun—we're at the end of the first
dry season—filling the empty stairwell as we climb. When we return in an hour or
so, it'll be pitch dark and we'll be picking out planets in the clear night sky.

We are in Kenya for our annual company retreat. We do this at least once a year:
gathering our team from across Africa and Europe and meeting face-to-face,
old-school, all-analog (baby). We share a week of smiles, playlists, brainstorms
and understanding.

Actually, specifically right now, we're a little ways east of Nairobi, at the
new [Vijana Amani Pamoja](https://vijanaamanipamoja.org/) (Peace Together Youth)
community centre. VAP uses sport to enable, empower and uplift kids and young
adults across Kenya. That means kids kick around a football and get tested for
HIV at half-time. It also means turning the global fascination with football
into a building—a physical safe space with caring adults, vocational skills
training, and gender-based-violence recovery units for children who may not even
care for the game. The real power of sport is its power to mobilize. To connect.

Enouce and his partner Nancy built all this from nothing. Well, okay, twenty
years of sweat and toil and giving a damn and strategic partnerships and
fundraising and dreaming big, oh so big. But on this small patch of earth,
Enouce is building a base to shelter kids and help them build better lives for
themselves.

This is grassroots aid, Kenyans helping Kenyans.

And they're not even close to stopping. Right now, they are lodging a bid to
host the
[Homeless World Cup](https://www.homelessworldcup.org/stories/more-than-a-game-using-football-to-drive-social-change-in-kenya).
I hope they get it—but there's a lot of work to do. We actually came to play
some five-a-side, but the pitch was dug up for renovation that very morning.

VAP is one of the reasons we travel all this way, hopping trains and catching
planes from London, Lisbon, Cape Town, Riga, Dakar, Budapest et al; why we put
up with Murder Birds screaming all night long; why we get the vaccinations and
stare down hippos and wonder if we can drink the water from the taps and leave
behind everyone we love.

We come here to observe, understand and discuss our impact on the world. We come
here to check in on the mission (since you ask—increasing the efficiency of the
social sector; we automate rote tasks, saving time and money for NGOs and
governments across the Global South while increasing the quality of service
delivery).

And of course, the opportunity to meet each other, to communicate face to face,
is irresistible. Priceless. Our team is totally remote, almost each of us in a
different country, so far apart that we measure it in timezones. We make the
most of every minute.

The launch of [OpenFn v2](https://www.openfn.org/blog/lightning-is-here)
(codenamed Lightning ⚡) dominates the agenda, of course. We plan how to bring
our next-gen open source workflow automation software to market; work out how to
talk about it; list what is left to be done.

We discuss ambitious "moonshot" ideas, dreaming about AI-assisted workflows,
seamless onboarding, live playgrounds. We recap the mission—not that we really
need to—and remind ourselves why what we do matters. We set context for each
other, learn about each other.

We somehow pack ourselves and our luggage into a van that can't possibly fit us
and yet somehow does (shoutout to driver and miracle worker Dixon, shoutout to
the hotel staff that agreed to look after his subwoofers for the weeekend). A
two-hour drive takes almost the whole day.

We cycle across Hell's Gate National Park (some of us more _up_ than _across_);
we swim in sulphurous hot springs; we feed giraffes, watch fish eagles soar and
dive. We are burgled by a baboon (not even joking) and hippos graze outside our
cabins at night.

Our CEO Taylor Downs walks around wrapped in a blanket, looking like a late-era
Luke Skywalker, doing chameleon impressions across the grass. He keeps saying
"my friend!" and its contagious. (What's a Subramanian, I wonder?)

We order so much Tusker and Stoney that our hotel throws a complimentary
cocktail hour for us.

Everything is great. Co-working in the real is a joy. Decisions are getting
made. Kenya is paradise.

But something is wrong with this picture.

Time and again it strikes me that, busy as we are, the world around us moves at
a very different pace.

We drive down red, rocky roads, lined with people just... waiting. No-one
rushes. Staff at our hotel work dawn to dust and beyond—longer than we do. Our
driver takes us to the office and, with nothing better to do, waits around
on-site, washing the bus, chatting with the security guards. OpenFn is obsessed
with a certain kind of efficiency, and yet... something about this kind of
living does _not_ seem iniefficient. It does not seem wasteful.

When Dave Graeber wrote about
["bullshit jobs"](https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/the-bullshit-job-boom),
I don't think this is what he meant.

There seems to be a lot of spare time here. I wonder about that.

If I ever work out what it means, I'll let you know.

Maybe this is the real reason we're here. We spend our lives fighting
inequality, in our own small, specialised way, reducing inefficiency in parts of
the world where every dollar, every drop of water, is precious.

Maybe the only way to understand our impact is to immerse ourselves in places
like this. Maybe this is how we understand the mission.

|             AkiraChix HQ             |

Hang on, I'm trying to round off this ramble into some kind of point but I
haven't even told you about [AkiraChix](https://akirachix.com/) yet. That's the
best bit.

The AkiraChix HQ hosts us for our working conference. They are a sort of a
sister organisation for us as we are both funded (in part) by the Patrick J.
McGovern Foundation and Steele Foundation for Hope.

The heart of AkiraChix is the
[codeHive](https://akirachix.com/programs/codeHive/) program: a one year,
live-in coding bootcamp for young adult women. The students live and learn on
the beautiful campus in the Nairobi district of Karen, learning about front-end
web development, dev-ops, distributed systems, game development, and more. All
accommodation, tuition and food costs are covered.

When their training is completed they go off and work in industry (they cite an
80% placement rate last year), but also come back to the campus to teach and
support the next cohort.

We are lucky enough to speak to some of these young women. The students are
quiet, polite, softly spoken, curious. The graduates are bold, outspoken,
switched-on. The difference is night and day, the transformation remarkable.

This is a lifeline in a world where tech roles tend to be inaccessible and
intimidating to women, where girls are driven away from science, maths and
computing and towards family, fashion and art. It's an endemic cultural problem
in "the west" and even worse in many parts of Africa, where crippling poverty
and inequality exacerbates the problem, chokes the pool of opportunity.

Maybe the proof is in the pudding. Long before we knew about the mission, before
we know just what AkiraChix were up to here in Nairobi, we actually hired one of
their graduates. Because she was just that good.

Also, the food they served every day was incredible—colourful, varied,
imaginative, playful, and the dishes were all perfectly executed. I've never
eaten better. We came from a dozen _major_ cities across Europe and Africa and
none of us could shut up about how good the food was.

I've not travelled in Kenya before and I've got to admit that in the UK the
general perception of the quality of life here is simply much different than
what I found.

Kenya can be a true paradise—I've met the people who are trying to make that
happen—but it is not right now. Not for everyone anyway. We have got to keep
working, to keep driving at this wedge of inequality. We've got to empower
individuals, civil society, governments across the developing world with
technology—really good, careful, considerate technology—so they can chart their
own futures.

I like where they're going and I can't wait until my next family dinner in a
healthier, safer, more equitable, and _even more_ inspiring Kenya. Tuko pamoja.
