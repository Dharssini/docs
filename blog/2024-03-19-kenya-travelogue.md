We all staring at a concrete block. We are hot, a little bewildered, deeply impressed.

Enouce just laughs (he does that a lot) and leads us up a flight of unfinished stairs, all rough concrete and exposed metal.

It's nice and light now, the last drips of African sun filling the empty stairwell as we climb. When we return in an hour or so, it'll be pitch dark and we'll be picking out planets in the clear night sky.

We are in Kenya for our annual company retreat. We try and do this at least once a year: gathering our team from across Europe and Africa and meeting face-to-face, old-school, all-analog baby. We share a week of smiles, playlists, brainstorms and understanding.

Actually, specifically right now, we're a little ways east of Nairobi, at the new Vijana Amani Pamoja (Peace Together Youth) community centre. VAP uses sport to enable, empower and uplift kids and young adults across Kenya. That means kids kick around a football and get tested for HIV at half-time

Enouce built all this from nothing. Well, okay, twenty years of sweat and toil and giving a damn and securing funding and dreaming big, oh so big. But on this patch of Kenyan wasteland, on land too rough to even kick a football across, Enouce is building a base to shelter kids and help them build better lives for themselves.

This is grassroots aid, Kenyans helping Kenyans.

Right now, they are bidding to host the [Homeless World Cup](https://www.homelessworldcup.org/stories/more-than-a-game-using-football-to-drive-social-change-in-kenya). I hope they get it - but there's a lot of work to do. We actually came to play some five-a-side - but the pitch was dug up for renovation that very morning.

VAP is one of the reasons we travel all this way, hopping trains and catching planes from London, Lisbon, Riga, Dakar, Budapest, more; why we put up with Murder Birds screaming all night long; why we get the vaccinations and stare down hippos and wonder if we can drink the water and leave behind everyone we love.

We come here to observe, understand and discuss our impact on the world. We come here to check in on the mission (since you ask - increasing the efficient of the social sectory; automating rote tasks; increasing the quality and accuracy of social care worldwide). 

And of course, the opportunity to meet each other, to communicate face to face, is irresistible. Priceless. Our team is totally remote, almost each of us in a different country, so far apart that we measure it in time. We make the most of every minute.

And we talk. The launch of OpenFn v2 (codenamed Lightning) dominates the agenda, of course. We plan how to bring our next-gen open source workflow automation software to market; work out how to talk about it; list what is left to be done.

We discuss ambitious "moonshot" ideas, dreaming about AI-assisted workflows, seamless onboarding, live playgrounds. We recap the mission - not that we really need to - and remind ourselves why what we do matters. We set context for each other, learn about each other.

It's been a wild week. We've cycled across Hell's Gate National Park (well, some of us); we've swum in sulphurous hot springs; we've fed giraffes; filmed fish eagles; been burgled by baboons (not even joking).

Taylor walks around wrapped in a blanket, looking like late-era Luke Skywalker, does impressions of chameleons on the grass. Life is never dull with Taylor around.

We somehow packed ourselves and our luggage into a van that can't possibly fit us and yet somehow does (shoutout to driver and miracle worker Dixon).

We ordered so much Tusker and Stoney that our hotel threw a complimentary cocktail hour for us.

Everything is great. Co-working in the real is a joy. Decisions are getting made. Kenya is paradise.

But something is wrong with this picture.

Time and again it strikes me that, busy as we are, the world around us moves at a very different place.

We drive down red, rocky roads, lined with people just... waiting. No-one rushes. Staff at our hotel work dawn to dust and beyond - longer than we do. Our driver takes us to the office and, with nothing better to do, waits around on-site, washing the bus, chatting the the security guards.

When Dave Graeber wrote about "bullshit jobs", I don't think this is what he meant.

There seems to be a lot of spare time here. I wonder about that. If I ever work out what it means, I'll let you know.

Maybe this is the real reason we're here. We spend our lives fighting inequality, in our own small, specialised way, reducing inefficiency in parts of the world where every dollar, every drop of water, is precious.

Maybe the only way to understand our impact is to immerse ourselves in places like this. Maybe this is how we understand the mission.

Hang on, I'm trying to round off this ramble into some kind of point but I haven't even told you about [AkiraChix](https://akirachix.com/) yet - that's the best bit.

Hosting us for our working conference is the amazing AkiraChix. Sort of a sister organisation for us as we are both funded (in part) by the McGovern Foundation.

The heart of AkiraChix is the [codeHive](https://akirachix.com/programs/codeHive/) program: a one year, live-in coding bootcamp for young adult women. The students live and learn on the beautiful campus in the Nairobi district of Karen. All accommodation, tuition and food costs are covered.

This is a lifeline in a world where tech roles are inaccessible and intimidating to many women, where girls are driven away from science, maths and computing and towards fashion and art. It's an endemic cultural problem in "the west" and even worse in Africa, where crippling poverty exacerbate the problem.

It's such a valuable, important, righteous, and cool project that we hired one of their graduates.

We were blessed to use their facilities for the week.

As awesome as everything else is about AkiraChix, the food they served every day was incredible. I've never eaten better.

And doesn't that just tell you something about Western perceptions of Africa? Yes, there is famine and poverty and incredible hardship across the continent. But there are also passionate, talented people, providing critical services every single day.

Maybe it's not true for everyonem but for me, Kenya is paradise.

Here's to making it a safe, productive and inspiring place for even more people.
