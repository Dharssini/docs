For the last few years, several OpenFn contributors and I have been blogging
over at Medium. I'm still going to write there from time to time as part of the
[OpenFn Founder's Blog](https://www.medium.com/@taylordowns2000), but today, I'm
excited to announce the launch of our own, new, more tightly integrated blog.

<!--truncate-->

It will give us more flexibility to tell the stories of our clients journeys to
scale, and all of the contributors to the OpenFn blog can post in the same
place. You can still follow us and receive notifications by subscribing below,
and we hope you'll do so.

For now, happy integrating!

â€” Taylor
