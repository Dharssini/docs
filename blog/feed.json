What&#x27;s a health information exchange, and what does it mean for\npeople in everyday terms?</p><p>A health information exchange allows for health data to be entered once and\nreused across different systems by defining standards and communication\nprotocols that enable many systems to work with the same data.</p><p><img src=\"https://wiki.ohie.org/download/attachments/41943663/openimis%20hie%20arch.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1573566637897&amp;api=v2\" alt=\"OpenHIE Framework\" title=\"OpenHIE Framework\"/></p><p>We can imagine various real world use cases for implementing a health\ninformation exchange architecture. My cousin Mariam’s experience with healthcare\nin Conakry serves as an example. After visiting three clinics and hospitals in\nConakry, Mariam was diagnosed with kidney stones at the fourth one. All of the\ndata that was collected in the first three clinics were not accessible to her\ndoctor at the fourth one. At each clinic the same data was collected and doctors\nrelied on Mariam to provide her medical history. They asked about past visits,\nprevious diagnoses, prescriptions, lab results, etc. Her medical history was\nspread across paper and electronic systems, in her home, at different\npharmacies, and in labs. Imagine how much faster she could have been diagnosed\nand treated if her healthcare workers had access to a comprehensive view of her\nmedical history.</p><p>A health information exchange would mitigate these issues and allow data to be\nstored in a single database. All authorized stakeholders would be able to access\nand update this single health record and Mariam wouldn’t need to stress about\nher paper prescription she lost from years ago. <strong>Patient data is only one piece\nof the puzzle and other important health data such as information on facilities,\nproviders, and supplies can also be managed in the health information exchange\nsystem.</strong></p><h3>OpenFn&#x27;s Role</h3><p>Two key components of a health information exchange are <strong>interoperability and\ndata standards.</strong> The OpenFn Integration Toolkit is a tool for interoperability\nsolution design, implementation, and adherence to data standards in health\ninformation exchange–key for organizations seeking to securely increase\ninteroperability across systems and partners, reduce costs, strengthen health\nsystems, and improve service delivery. Released this year, the Toolkit is a\ndigital global good that helps health and humanitarian organizations and\ngovernments automate key processes and integrate critical information systems.\nIt was developed in partnership with 45+ social sector partners, incorporating\nresources and learnings from dozens of implementations to deliver a suite of\nopen-source documentation, implementation tools, and a templates library that\nfast-tracks interoperability and automation projects.</p><p>For more information visit the links below:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://academy.ohie.org/\">https://academy.ohie.org/</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/documentation/\">https://docs.openfn.org/documentation/</a></li></ul><p>— Aicha</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>In 2020, Robert MacTavish, a child protection specialist at UNICEF Primero lead,\nmet with the team at OpenFn and laid out a massive challenge facing the Ministry\nof Social Affairs, Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation in Cambodia. He explained\nthat there was no secure, stable, scalable way to share data between different\ncase management systems operated by the government and partner agencies. The\nresult, he went on, was not merely an increased administrative burden but\nre-victimization. Children might have to recount their whole case history,\nreliving their traumas time and time again in order to register and access each\ncritical support service they needed.</p><p><img src=\"/img/unicef-cambodia-cc-daravatey-seng.jpg\" alt=\"UNICEF Cambodia (c) Daravatey Seng 2020\"/></p><h3>Fast forward...</h3><p>...to the spring of 2021 and child protection case data is now being securely\ntransmitted between systems as part of a fully automated, secure referral\nworkflow running through OpenFn.</p><blockquote><p>If you’re not familiar with OpenFn, it’s an integration platform and toolkit\nthat has been used in over 40 countries to automate business processes,\nconnect disparate systems, and facilitate secure, stable, scalable data\nsharing.

You\ncan read more about it in the\n<a href=\"https://www.khmertimeskh.com/50814828/beefing-up-child-protection-case-management/\">Khmer Times</a>,\nthe\n<a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/cambodia/press-releases/interoperability-between-primero-and-oscar-goes-live\">UNICEF press release</a>,\nor\n<a href=\"https://community.primero.org/t/interoperability-in-primero-with-openfn-is-changing-the-way-we-work/360\">Primero’s community forum</a>,\nbut here I want to focus on a slightly more nuanced learning that came from this\n<a href=\"https://openfn.github.io/unicef-cambodia/\">project</a> and Digital Square’s recent\ninvestment in the OpenFn “Open Source Integration Toolkit”.</p><h3>Implementations aren’t always re-usable, but platforms and processes ARE.</h3><p>We built OpenFn because we were frustrated by the amount of time and money that\nwas being spent rebuilding the digital infrastructure required for secure,\nrobust, long-lasting integrations. Each integration project may be completely\ndifferent in terms of <em>how</em> data is processed (i.e., the “business rules”) but\nthere are some basic requirements and best-practices that can serve as the\nbuilding blocks for successful interoperability across almost any set of\nsystems. That’s no surprise to us; it’s the fundamental premise of OpenFn.\nWhat’s expanded dramatically through our work in Cambodia, however, is our\ncollection of <em><strong>reusable processes</strong></em>—how to approach integration long before\nyou open up a computer—that can now serve as a template for future projects.</p><p>One such process is the “Integration Checklist”, a non-technical checklist that\nhelps organizations bring together relevant stakeholders and define the value\nand rules of an integration. This is no small thing. In the Primero post\nmentioned above, Jan Panchalingam, also a Child Protection Specialist at UNICEF,\nwrites that implementing OpenFn is “changing the way they work”.</p><p>The “aha” moment for those involved in this project was that the artifacts\nproduced in an OpenFn implementation—actual\n<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/documentation/build/triggers\">“triggers”</a> and\n<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/documentation/build/jobs\">“jobs”</a> written with and for\nthe Open Source Integration Toolkit—publicly memorialize the data sharing\nagreements between partners.</p><p>I want to stick with that for a moment: <strong>the implementation <em>is</em> the\nagreement!</strong></p><p>:::success</p><p>By <strong>operationalizing a data sharing agreement</strong> through OpenFn, these\norganizations now have machine-readable granularity, full revision history, and\nproof-of-processing for their contract.</p><p>:::</p><p>A huge portion of the work required to make the case management systems\ninteroperable was done on calls, walking through different referral flows and\nprivacy requirements and getting buy-in from various stakeholders and legal\nentities. Now, the output of those crucial conversations are not just notes or a\nsigned MOU and careful task lists for system admins, they are a series of\nscripts that are stored and actually enacted, faithfully, automatically, and\nmany times every day by the OpenFn platform–automating data exchange between\npartner agencies.</p><p>By implementing OpenFn—defining the case referral process and the requirements\nof the agreement in machine-readable levels of specificity—they’ve actually\nremoved huge amounts of ambiguity and helped standardize the data sharing\nagreements between partner ministries/organizations.</p><p>And the reusability of these processes isn’t just theoretical. They are already\nbeing applied in three other big UNICEF implementations as we speak. The next to\ngo live will be in Thailand.</p><p>UNICEF and the Thai Ministry of Public Health are working to enable social\nprotection caseworkers using the Primero app to access relevant patient medical\nhistory securely, via OpenFn and a ministry-managed API gateway. By\nforegrounding the checklist, and making sure all the stakeholders in these\nsensitive data-sharing agreements are on board with the concept that this\nimplementation is a way of formalizing and enforcing data sharing agreements,\nthe teams have been able to move much more confidently through the initial\nprototyping process. At OpenFn, we plan to continue to build out the open source\nprocess documentation that goes alongside the software—making it easier for\nfolks everywhere to achieve durable interoperability and manifest their data\nsharing agreements.</p><h3>One more thing. On the subject of open source.</h3><p><strong>Open source is about freedom of choice, not money.</strong></p><p>For the moment, in both Cambodia and Thailand, the implementations are running\non OpenFn.org—our proprietary cloud-hosted service—but in both cases they’re\nalready evaluating plans to migrate these implementations to make use of the\nFOSS-only deployment pathway we provide in the Open Source Integration Toolkit.</p><p>I think that’s hugely important. A cloud-hosted service might be the best option\nfor a given ministry during prototype, pilot, scale-up, or even national-scale\ndeployments—oftentimes they’re less expensive and more secure—<b><i>but for\nsystems as important as these, it’s absolutely critical that they’re not locked\nin.</i></b></p><p>Governments must be free to export that implementation and run it on completely\nopen source software that they can debug, on whatever servers they’d like, with\nsupport from whatever vendors they choose.</p><p>This is what recent investment in the Open Source Integration Toolkit, from\nDigital Square, the FCDO, DIAL, and our team here at OpenFn has made possible.\nFrom software, to documentation, to process and implementation guides like those\nmentioned above, the goal of the toolkit is to build up the integration\ncapability of the sector at large. Ultimately the toolkit will ensure that\nOpenFn implementations aren’t forever reliant on a single company. It will\nincrease the substantive freedom of governments to make long-term plans and take\nlong-term ownership of their integration solutions, without having to re-code\nthe wheel.</p><h3>To take action</h3><p>To join our community please sign up to our\n<a href=\"https://community.openfn.org/\">community page </a>and feel free to contribute and\nask questions on the forum.</p><p>If your organization is thinking about interoperability and would like to learn\nmore about OpenFn’s platform or open-source offerings please contact\n<a href=\"mailto:services@openfn.org\">services@openfn.org</a> for a free consultation.</p><p>Also, be sure to stay tuned to our <a href=\"/blog\">blog</a>, or subscribe to our\n<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/hcOw8H\">newsletter</a> to stay up to date with all ICT4D\nintegration related news.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://wiki.digitalsquare.io/index.php/What_are_Global_Goods\">Digital global goods</a>\nare adaptable, interoperable, open source software or content designed to meet\nthe data and management needs of country health systems. Incredible software\ntools like <a href=\"https://www.dimagi.com/commcare/\">CommCare</a>, a mobile data\ncollection and service delivery platform, <a href=\"https://dhis2.org/\">dhis2</a>, a health\nmanagement information system (HMIS) used in over 40 countries, and\n<a href=\"https://openlmis.org/\">OpenLMIS</a>, a popular logistics system, are digital\nglobal goods. OpenFn is proud to now be officially joining them on this list.</p><p><img src=\"/img/george-washington-bridge.jpg\" alt=\"Bridge as public good\"/></p><h3>The imperative for digital global goods</h3><p>The story of digital global goods began in July 2018 when the Secretary General\nof the United Nations convened a High-Level Panel on Digital Cooperation to\nstrengthen impact and better direct global efforts in the digital arena. What\nmotivated this panel’s formation was a growing awareness that as digital\ntechnology reshapes economies and society, it is imperative that the\ntechnologies deployed do not exacerbate global inequities, but instead seek to\naddress them.</p><p>Co-Chaired by Melinda Gates and Jack Ma, the panel’s\n<a href=\"https://digitalcooperation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DigitalCooperation-report-web-FINAL-1.pdf\">final report</a>\nprovided recommendations for how the international community could work together\nto harness digital technologies for positive change. One of the key action items\nthat emerged in the report’s aftermath was a call for global investment into the\ncreation of <strong>digital public goods to help attain the sustainable development\ngoals. </strong>Specifically, availability and accessibility to digital public\ngoods—and the data they collect—was introduced as being essential to address\nissues of digital inclusion for all regardless of location, race, gender,\nreligion or socioeconomic standing.</p><h3>What is open source?</h3><p>Not all open source projects are digital public goods, but all digital public\ngoods must be open source. Open source software is code that is publicly\naccessible—anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit. Many\ngovernments and international NGOs prefer open source software because of\ncustomization and data residency requirements. Since our founding in 2014 OpenFn\nhas been committed to open-source software development and the source code for\nmost of the products we’ve built is freely available on\n<a href=\"https://github.com/OpenFn\">Github</a>.</p><p>Notably, even though open source software is “free” the cost of deploying it and\nmaintaining it carries costs that are sometimes comparable to commercial\nsoftware licenses.\n<a href=\"https://digitalsquare.org/blog/2020/2/13/openness-and-value-in-the-digital-health-sector\">Digital Square </a>explains\nthis dynamic further: “The misconception of open source as ‘free’ may be better\nunderstood through the Romance languages. Open source is\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre\">libre, not gratis</a>: free as\nin speech, not as in lunch. In the case of many low resource settings, this is\nthe right kind of free. The need for adaptability is balanced by the ability to\nadapt a software.”</p><p>An example of a successful open source software project that is also classified\nas a digital public good is <a href=\"https://openlmis.org/\">OpenLMIS</a>. OpenLMIS is the\nleading logistics system used to track health products across national supply\nchains and while they credit their open source approach as being responsible for\ntheir deployment success to date, they have also experienced challenges related\nto their business model. Business model challenges force open source project\nmaintainers like OpenLMIS and OpenFn to explore different types of revenue\nstreams that ensure long term sustainability of the projects.</p><h3>How OpenFn’s business model will enable long term sustainability of its open source project</h3><p>Historically, lacking grant funding and without outside investors, OpenFn\ndecided that the best way to continue delivering high-impact implementations and\nkeep a laser focus on the needs of real-world NGOs that we serve was to build a\nlicensed, closed-source software-as-a-service (SaaS) product offering (see\n<a href=\"http://www.openfn.org\">openfn.org</a>). This product is dependent on the huge\nsuite of open-source software that we continue to invest in for the good of the\nlarger community—“core”, “adaptors”, and almost all of the software we build is\nopen source—but by licensing our SaaS we’ve been able to create a steady stream\nof revenue that is only dependent on real-world customers seeing and paying for\nthe value they get by using the product. Selling subscriptions to the OpenFn\nplatform has not only helped it grow into a strong, trusted, enterprise-grade\nproduct, but it has bootstrapped our implementation arm, subsidized our “free\nforever” enterprise tier, and funded the further development of our open source\ntools.</p><p>Thanks to recent support from DIAL, DFID and Digital Square, OpenFn is now able\nto invest more time and energy into our open-source tools—building new software\nto compete with and complement more directly our licensed platform and working\nto make the existing tools more accessible to a wider audience.The licensed\nplatform and our open source project have a symbiotic relationship with one\nanother. Open source innovation drives platform innovation and vice versa.\nCrucially, both rely on each other.</p><p>With a more robust\n<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/documentation/microservice/home\">open source offering </a>and\na heavy investment in documentation, it will be easier than ever for\norganizations to get up and running with OpenFn and then choose whether they\nwant to scale their solutions on the platform or deploy them on their own\ninfrastructure using nothing but free open source software (FOSS).</p><p>Some will still choose to use our hosted offering, and we’ll be encouraged to\nfurther differentiate that offering through the value that it provides—<!-- -->_<!-- -->not\n<!-- -->_<!-- -->merely by virtue of it being proprietary. In fact, we see a future in which\nNGOs and governments may shift seamlessly between all of our tools. We’ve\ndeveloped them with exactly this in mind, ensuring zero lock-in despite the\nvarying licenses.</p><h3>What does this mean, concretely?</h3><p>In the past it was quite challenging to use OpenFn’s open source tools, and we\nfeel that they didn’t provide enough functionality, out-of-the-box, to our\nusers. It’s not surprising to find, then, that almost all of OpenFn’s users were\non the proprietary platform. Going forward our\n<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/documentation/deploy/options\">open source integration toolkit,</a>\nincluding OpenFn/devtools, OpenFn/core, OpenFn/engine, and OpenFn/microservice,\nwill be more robust, user friendly and accessible. This means that anyone,\nanywhere can build integration and automation solutions more quickly and\ninteroperability solutions will be within reach to organizations with varying\ntechnical capabilities.</p><p>Versatility is a key component of our open source vision. We are constructing a\nsystem that users can grow and mature with. While our enterprise platform might\nbe right for your organization today, 5 years from now, once your organization\nhas its own dedicated IT team and server infrastructure, local deployment via\nmicroservice might make better sense. The good news is that OpenFn integration\n<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/documentation/portability\">portability</a> will make these\ntransitions easy. Your integration will run just as well on your servers as\nours.</p><p>As the diagram below demonstrates we envision two main pathways for OpenFn\nintegrations. The tech savvy project manager will configure their workflows via\nour intuitive platform, while the power IT user will configure their workflows\nfrom the command line. Regardless of the chosen approach, there is flexibility\nto change paths whenever required.</p><p><img src=\"/img/deployment_paths.png\" alt=\"Deployment Paths\"/></p><p>Again, <em>concretely</em>, this means our users will have more and better options for\nhow they run their data integration solutions. While they might use\nOpenFn/platform to build and test solutions, they could easily choose to run\nthose same solutions on their own servers via OpenFn/microservice.

Key\noutcomes achieved so far via this partnership include the implementation of a\nsecure OpenFn project space with the automated data sharing workflows required\nto allow for the Cambodian government and their partner NGO caseworkers to\ncommunicate with one another seamlessly.</p><p><img src=\"/img/cambodia_school.png\" alt=\"Cambodia School\"/></p><p>Case management applications help social service providers coordinate critical\nsupport activities for vulnerable children; ensuring that they can securely\nconnect with one another and automating the flow of data between themshare and\nthe launch of these integration features is especially important amidst an\nincrease in the rates of domestic and gender based violence linked to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the secure workflows the automation\nallows—critically, facilitating the complex referral process—brings the child\nprotection system in Cambodia one step closer to the collective dream of\nproviding holistic, compassionate care.</p><h3>The Key Partners</h3><p>The Child Protection team at UNICEF Cambodia, working in concert with the\ncountry’s Child Welfare Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans\nand Youth Rehabilitation (MoSVY) defined the scope of the interoperability\nrequirements and guided this program’s implementation. Because achieving\ninteroperability can be complex, OpenFn was brought into the consortium to offer\nexpert integration insights and to provide the digital infrastructure required\nto enable the program’s goals.</p><h3>The Systems Integrated</h3><p>The systems OpenFn integrated for the first phase of this project are\n<a href=\"https://www.primero.org/\">Primero</a> and <a href=\"https://oscarhq.com/\">OSCaR</a>. Primero\nis an open source software platform that helps social services, humanitarian and\ndevelopment workers manage protection-related data, with modules that facilitate\ncase management, incident monitoring and family tracing and reunification. OSCaR\n(Open Source Case-management and Record-keeping) is a case management software\nsystem that is used by civil society organizations in Cambodia to manage cases\nor children in residential care.</p><p><img src=\"/img/primero_oscar.png\" alt=\"Primero OpenFn Oscar Diagram\"/></p><p>First a definition: “Interoperability”, in this context, is the automated\nability of computer systems to work in concert with (sharing data and\ncollaborating on processes with) other systems. Defining interoperability is the\neasy part; achieving it is another story. “In a complex, interagency project\nlike this, it’s true that the technologies in play often don’t ‘speak the same\nlanguage’, but neither do the partners,” writes Aleksa Krolls, OpenFn’s Head of\nServices. “Our job is not only to facilitate the flow of data between systems,\nbut to facilitate the process by which our partners—human users—communicate\nmeaning across multiple agencies and people.”</p><p>In this example, OpenFn’s software is acting as the “translator” between the\nOSCaR and Primero systems. OpenFn’s primary interoperability objective for this\nfirst phase was to facilitate Cambodian government partners and local\nnon-governmental organizations in systematic registration and tracking of\nchildren in Cambodia, including facilitating duplicate detection between systems\nand enabling easy-to-use processes for updating beneficiary/client details.</p><h3>The work is just beginning</h3><p>OpenFn’s work with UNICEF Cambodia and the MoSVY doesn’t end here though. We are\nnow beginning the process of enabling further Primero interoperability with\nsoftware like ProGres v2, UNHCR’s institutional tool, as well as enabling\nPrimero-to-Primero implementations in the field. We’ll be sure to keep the\ncommunity updated as the project progresses.</p><p>Many of the best responses to the critical issues we face as a society emerge\nfrom collaboration and interoperability enables collaboration in the digital\ndomain. Just as no single actor or organization can deliver all the services\nrequired to protect vulnerable children and survivors of violence, no single\ntechnology can be successful operating in isolation.</p><p>Case management automation allows for a social worker to spend more time being\nthere for the vulnerable populations they serve and less time copying and\npasting data between the applications they use. This partnership between OpenFn,\nUNICEF Cambodia and the MoSVY means that fewer children will need to painfully\nre-tell their traumas just to receive the help they need.</p><p>If your organization is in the health and humanitarian sector and is thinking\nabout automation and interoperability, contact <a href=\"mailto:services@openfn.org\">services@openfn.org</a> for a free\nconsultation.</p><p><strong>About UNICEF Cambodia:</strong> UNICEF Cambodia’s mission is to promote the healthy\ndevelopment of children, to defend their rights and help them fulfil their\npotential, from early childhood to adolescence.</p><p><strong>About Cambodia’s Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation\n(MoSVY):</strong> Cambodia’s MoSVY is a government agency with a broad mandate that\nincludes supporting the efforts of social workers across the country.</p><p><strong>About OpenFn Group:</strong> Open Function Group (“OFG”) helps health and\nhumanitarian interventions in 40+ countries achieve scale and improve service\ndelivery through automation, data integration, and interoperability solutions.</p>",

Nal’ibali aims to\nimprove academic success by promoting reading and writing in mother tongue\nlanguages, which is important in a country that has has 11 official languages.</p><h3>Nal&#x27;ibali uses language and cultural relevance to develop literacy in a nationwide campaign.</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.nalibali.org/\">Nal’ibali</a> (isiXhosa for &#x27;here&#x27;s the story&#x27;) is a\nnational reading-for-enjoyment initiative to use the power of stories, either\noral or written and in many different languages, to inspire children to want to\nread and write. Since this campaign began in 2012, it has had a tremendous\nimpact across South Africa through: 11,132 reading clubs (5220 of which are\ncurrently active), 159,191 participants, and 1,419,035 stories distributed.</p><h3>With multiple systems and programs, there was no single-view of children&#x27;s literacy progress.</h3><p>To manage its nationwide literacy campaign, Nal&#x27;ibali used a collection of\ntechnology platforms for data collection, reporting, and program management.\nNal&#x27;ibali implemented Salesforce for enhanced data management. However,\nNal&#x27;ibali still needed to integrate its OpenDataKit (ODK) data collection tools\nand online learning management system with Salesforce to track the entire\nprogram journey and progress of a child beneficiary in one, single-view.</p><h3>OpenFn integrates online and offline data sources so that Nal&#x27;ibali can monitor children&#x27;s progress across <em>all</em> literacy programs.</h3><p>To integrate siloed data sources and introduce automated SMS to boost reader\nengagement, Nal’ibali implemented OpenFn to:</p><ol><li>sync all data collection tools across programs and activities for single-view\nmonitoring,</li><li>integrate Salesforce with Everlytic SMS to support direct communication with\nbeneficiaries, and</li><li>enable live monitoring of its reach through a live, integrated map\nvisualization that tracks the locations of reading clubs</li></ol><p>These OpenFn-powered integrations save the Nal’ibali team several hours every\nmonth on data management processes and activity reporting. The connected data\nsystems also ensure Nal&#x27;ibali M&amp;E staff can quickly and easily monitor reading\nclubs across South Africa, and analyze which campaigns have been the most\neffective.</p><p>As Nal’ibali continues to scale its programs and reach, it released a new online\nlearning site for its readers earlier this year. Check it out the new site at\n<a href=\"https://www.nalibali.mobi\">www.nalibali.mobi</a>!

The foundation began an HIV program in Haiti in 2007\nto support the healthy development of children and families by tracking and\nassisting the clinical follow-up of HIV positive and HIV vulnerable pregnant\nwomen, mothers, and children.</p><p>In collaboration with the Ministry of Health, the National Laboratory of Public\nHealth (read more\n<a href=\"https://www.fondation-merieux.org/en/news/the-ministry-of-public-health-and-population-launches-haitis-first-national-laboratory-policy/\">here</a>\nas well as other hospitals and organizations operating in Haiti, the Caris\nFoundation currently supports 150 hospitals across all 10 provinces, including\nsupport in hard-to-reach districts and remote islands.</p><h3>Operating across 7 regional offices, Caris Foundation’s network provides coverage to over 95% of the Haitian population.</h3><p>As part of Caris Foundation’s health worker outreach program, community health\nworkers (&quot;CHWs&quot;) complete daily home visits to children and pregnant women with\nsuspected lapses in clinical and drug adherence. During these visits, CHWs\nprovide vital services such as counseling for clinical adherence, nutrition\nscreening and distribution of essential health supplies like ARV medication,\nalbendazole, and chlorine for water treatment. These services support\nbeneficiaries to regularly attend medical appointments, adhere to drug treatment\nregimens, receive appropriate lab tests, and seek treatment for new or worsening\nhealth problems.</p><h3>Disconnected systems created week- and months-long reporting lags.</h3><p>Caris implemented <a href=\"https://dimagi.com/commcare/\">CommCare</a> to enable CHWs to\ncollect data offline via mobile phone when working in remote environments.\nHowever, all data collected for analysis, such as beneficiary profiles, services\nreceived, and follow-up visits, needed to be manually transcribed via paper\ncopies into the HIV Haiti MySQL database. This process would take a week (and up\nto several months) to complete, and sometimes the data collected would never\nmake it to the database.</p><h3>OpenFn data integration saves Caris Foundation staff thousands of hours, enabling live, automated reporting.</h3><p>OpenFn automatically processes and uploads data from approximately 5000 HIV\nvisits every month. Once in the database, the Caris Foundation is able to track\nthe progress of mothers and children as services are delivered in the field.</p><p>To date, OpenFn has automatically cleaned and uploaded 100,000+ CommCare\nsubmissions to the MySQL HIV database, saving Caris thousands of staff hours\npreviously spent on data entry and reporting processes. To quote Jenifer\nFleurant, IT Programmer at Caris Foundation, data integration has enabled the\norganization to “work towards a better experience for the patient, for the\nagent, and for external reporting.” Read our\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/@taylordowns2000/system-champions-caris-foundations-jenifer-fleurant-af4a4496d1d2\">interview with Jennifer here</a>.</p><p><em>The photo above was originally posted on the Caris Foundation\n<a href=\"http://www.carisfoundation.org/pediatric-hiv\">site.</a></em></p>",

For a census in\nSouth Africa in 2017, they were collecting household data using\n<a href=\"https://www.surveycto.com/\">SurveyCTO.</a> Each enumerator participating in the\nfieldwork was equipped with a tablet and an external GPS device for data\ncollection.</p><h4>iKapaData had no way to actively monitor data collection activities on the ground.</h4><p>As enumerators collected the census data, iKapaData wanted to analyze that\ndataset using two reporting applications, <a href=\"https://carto.com/\">Carto</a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.zoho.com/\">Zoho</a> – each with its own data model and required\nformats. To upload the data into the two reporting systems, iKapaData would have\nto rely on time-intensive manual data migration, and there was no easy way to\nactively monitor the census data collection.</p><h4>Real-time data integration enabled live survey monitoring and quicker analysis.</h4><p>OpenFn automation saved the iKapaData team valuable time typically spent on\nmanual data entry and cleaning processes. Using OpenFn, iKapaData set up\nautomated data cleaning and reporting pipelines that:</p><ul><li>Automatically extracted data from SurveyCTO on a scheduled basis,</li><li>Transformed data to the appropriate reporting formats for data and geo-spatial\nanalysis and,</li><li>Uploaded key results to Zoho Analytics, while also adding locations to a map\non CartoDB to display the locations already visited by enumerators.</li></ul><p>The real-time connection enabled live data monitoring for the team as iKapaData\nsurvey enumerators were conducting the survey.</p><p>Learn more about OpenFn and SurveyCTO integrations\n<a href=\"https://www.surveycto.com/blog/connecting-with-openfn/\">here.</a></p>",

Small-scale farmers are feeding the\nworld, but a majority of them are in an endless cycle of poverty and lack access\nto traditional banks and financing. In this post, we highlight our partner\nmyAgro, an organization leveraging OpenFn automation to help scale its programs\ntowards its goal of serving 1 million farmers in 2025.</p><p><img src=\"/img/myAgro1.JPG\" alt=\"myAgro\"/></p><h3>Here&#x27;s the overview.</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.myagro.org/\">myAgro</a> has pioneered an innovative bankless savings\nplan that allows thousands of farmers to finance themselves and invest their\nmoney in high-quality seeds, fertilizer, tools, and training. OpenFn automates\nmyAgro’s mobile layaway platform, powering a system where farmers can\nincrementally pay for agricultural inputs by purchasing savings vouchers in\nlocal stores—making deposits via SMS. myAgro holds those layaway payments until\nplanting time, when bulk purchases of seeds, fertilizers, and tools are\ndelivered to the farmers based on individualized plans.</p><h3>What is myAgro?</h3><p>myAgro helps thousands of farmers in Senegal and Mali save money for seed and\nfertilizer using what they already have—their mobile phone. With a mission to\nmove small-scale farmers out of poverty, myAgro leveraged OpenFn to develop a\nmobile layaway platform that connects their Telerivet SMS-based savings deposit\nsystem, Salesforce farmer tracking &amp; supply chain system, and CommCare\nbarcode-scanning mobile app.</p><p><img src=\"/img/farmers.jpg\" alt=\"myagro\"/></p><h3>Using Excel and paper to manage thousands of farmer transactions.</h3><p>In 2014, myAgro utilized <a href=\"https://telerivet.com/\">Telerivet</a>, an instant SMS and\nvoice platform, to capture farmer savings deposits, and paper to track voucher\nshipments. They would then regularly export the SMS data to an Excel\nspreadsheet, and manually match savings deposits against a database of vouchers\nbefore allocating credit to a farmer’s account and sending a confirmation SMS.\nStaff spent 1-2 hours per day (or 261+ hours per year) on this data\nreconciliation process, which had high potential for human error.</p><h3>Where OpenFn comes in...</h3><p>OpenFn moved this entire manual process over to the cloud, automating the\nsavings deposit system and connecting a CommCare barcode-scanning mobile app for\nreal-time farmer order management and inventory tracking. By integrating\nTelerivet and Salesforce, myAgro no longer has to rely on data entries and\nuploads that would take 1-2 hours each day.</p><p>OpenFn now processes all SMS messages automatically, builds trust by providing\ninstant confirmation to farmers, and eliminates the chance of human error in\nsavings allocations. OpenFn helped myAgro transition from managing rows and\ncolumns of data in an Excel spreadsheet to an automated savings and inventory\ntracking system that enables real-time program monitoring.</p><ul><li>In 2014, myAgro serviced 14,000 farmers across 200 villages in Senegal and\nMali.</li><li>With the help of OpenFn, myAgro worked with 120,000 farmers in 2019, and plans\nto scale towards its goal of reaching <code>1 million farmers</code> by 2025.</li></ul><p><img src=\"/img/myagrograph.jpg\" alt=\"myagro\"/></p><p>Read more about myAgro’s mission <a href=\"https://www.myagro.org/\">here</a>, and stay tuned\nas myAgro continues to scale its OpenFn implementation.</p>",

Non-technical readers click away when they read the\nformer, while developers see the latter and think it’s nonsense! (i.e.,\nIntegration is NEVER trivial.) This doesn’t leave a lot of you left here on\nsentence number 5. Thanks for sticking it out, and let me reward your patience\nby explaining why this is such a big deal and what we need from you to make it\nhappen.</p><p>By leveraging technology, we can make social programs more effective. Bigger,\nbetter, more complete solutions to issues of poverty, public health, and human\nrights are not only possible, but seem to be right on our doorstep thanks to\ntremendous advances in information technology in the last 25 years. Thousands of\ntools have been developed to address all sorts of needs across international\ndevelopment. While the tools and use-cases vary tremendously, there’s always one\nugly, expensive, technically complex constant lurking in the background.</p><p>(Enter “integration” stage left.)</p><p>Just as “no man is an island”, no single piece of technology can stand alone. We\nrely on integrations every day. Many applications are so tightly integrated that\nwe hardly notice. Gmail and Google Contacts almost behave like a single app. If\nyou’re lucky, Gmail and your calendar are also integrated. If you sync a folder\non your computer to Dropbox, there’s a nifty integration between your local\noperating system and Dropbox.com. All of these integrations save precious time —\nthey cut out a tedious manual step like uploading a copy of each photo you save\non your computer to a website.</p><p>Now imagine running a pediatric HIV clinic in Kenya. Beyond email, a calendar,\nand Dropbox, you rely on a fingerprint scanner to to quickly access patient IDs,\na smart-phone based data collection app for new patient intake during home\nvisits, an electronic medical record system to manage patient data securely, and\nan automated SsocMS service to notify workers and patients of upcoming visits.</p><h4>We should take a moment to be thankful for the progress we’ve made in “ICT4D”. It’s amazing that these technologies exist. They save time, money, and lives.</h4><p>The problem is that, for lack of a better metaphor, these technologies all speak\ndifferent languages. You can ask users to download data from one, make sense of\nit, and then upload it to another, but that’s a slow, expensive, and error-prone\ntask. (Not to mention the non-negligible fact that it’s horribly boring.) To get\nthe tos working together automatically you’re talking tens of thousands of\ndollars, and the integration you’re left with isn’t re-usable once your needs\nchange. What’s worse is that every time a new technology is implemented within\nan organization, consultants and developers must struggle anew to integrate it\nwith existing systems because there’s seldom the budget or foresight required to\nbuild a truly flexible and future-proof integration. This is the issue we’re\ntackling, head on.</p><h4>OpenFn is a “Rosetta Stone” that makes automating the constant flow of crucial information from one system to another as easy as point-and-click.</h4><p>Google.org called OpenFn’s attempt to provide easy and technology agnostic data\nintegration “the holy grail.” Stu, our own chief engineer had the same notion.\nAfter some hard work, it seems that the platform may really be that powerful,\nbut also far more attainable. Here’s how we do it:</p><p>We use (1) a universal standard for data storage, (2) standard information about\nwhat kinds of data are expected from “source applications” and “destination\napplications”, and (3) a user-friendly interface to generate “jobs”—sometimes\ncalled “automation scripts” or instructions for how to process data.</p><h4>A job might be to create a new patient record when fingerprints are scanned. Once a job is created, it can simply be “switched on” to run in the background while the human beings at your organization focus on much more important (and interesting!) things.</h4><p>For those of you who work in technology, the power of this strategy (namely,\nusing a universal standard) should be apparent. To integrate a new application,\na small adapter that translates data to JSON and provides a JSON-schema for your\ndatabase is all that’s required. Once one API connection to OpenFn is\nestablished, <strong><em>your technology is instantly connected to every other technology\nconnected to OpenFn–and OpenFn can connect any application.</em></strong> It will start to\nsnowball quickly, allowing data to flow instantly between hundreds of crucial\napplications, and each developer will only ever need to maintain a single\nconnection.</p><p><img src=\"/img/apps.png\" alt=\"apps\"/></p><p>Dozens of organizations worldwide use OpenFn to scale their interventions by\nautomating key processes and information flows. OpenFn solutions deliver\ncritical information, faster and unlock resources for organizations by\neliminating manual, time-intensive tasks. OpenFn connects any app–including\ncommon ICT4D tools like DHIS2, CommCare, Kobo Toolbox, and Salesforce, as well\nas databases, custom applications, and legacy systems. Drop us a note if you’re\nthinking about how to connect tools at your organization, or if you’re a\ndeveloper and wondering how to get your product connected to other essential\ntools in international development.</p><p>In the end, we’re talking about making it orders of magnitude faster and\nsignificantly less expensive to integrate key technologies. By automating the\nflow of data in social impact organizations we eliminate human error and reduce\nlag time—this means better information in the hands of decision makers, faster.\nAll this leads to one thing: bigger, better, and more complete solutions to some\nof the world&#x27;s biggest problems.</p><p>If you’d just like some more information about OpenFn and how we help leading\nimpact-first organizations scale their interventions, head over to\n<a href=\"https://www.openfn.org/solutions\">Solution Overviews - OpenFn.</a> To get all the\nlatest OpenFn updates, like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/openfn\">Facebook</a>\nand follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/openfn\">Twitter.</a></p>",

While this is an accepted rate in the\ncorporate world where CEOs are accustomed to doubling down, conflicting\npressures and tighter budgets in the social-impact space push the chance of\nfailure even higher. Without good data, decision makers from the field to the\nboardroom are hamstrung. Technology alone is never going to solve social\nproblems, but the inability to get it right has and will continue to sink\npromising development programs.

We’ve now worked with 125 clients in more than 40 countries. We’ve\nwitnessed our partners transform their organizations with good data systems. “É\numa revolução!” said one staffer at PSI Mozambique. We’ve also gained experience\nwith dozens of other technologies designed to serve social impact organizations.\nThese tools have enabled our partners to improve their operations in diverse\nways ranging from communicating by SMS with thousands of farmers in Mali, to\ncollecting loan repayments using MPESA in Kenya, to analyzing household survey\ndata in India.</p><p>Hundreds of these tools exist, but social impact organizations face three main\nbarriers to successful implementations:</p><ol><li>Picking the right tool is hard.</li><li>Even if you pick the right tool, a successful implementation of that tool\nhinges on solving complex people and process problems.</li><li>No single tool does it all, so you’ve got to figure out how to integrate more\nthan one — and they rarely ‘play nice’.</li></ol><p>Figuring out the people and the processes, that’s always going to be the hardest\npart to get right — whether or not the technical work presents a barrier.\nOpenfn.org’s first objective is to knock down the technical hurdles so that\norganizations can focus on that important contextual stuff.</p><p><img src=\"/img/techpic.jpg\"/></p><p>We see a future where the technical setup of a mobile money platform, a\nbiometrics tool, even an offline clinic registration platform, feels just like\ndownloading an app from the app store.</p><p>We’re still a long way from that reality, but we’ve built an\n<a href=\"https://www.openfn.org/pricing#open-source\">open-core</a> integration platform\nthat’s poised to bring together the “technology for development” landscape with\nclicks, not code.
