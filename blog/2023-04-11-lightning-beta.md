## We’re (soft) launching **OpenFn Lightning** _ -- the next generation of OpenFn automation tooling!_

It’s been a wild year and we’re excited to announce the next generation of
OpenFn’s **digital public good for workflow automation**: OpenFn Lightning.

Lightning represents our commitment to open source and the DPG community. It is
a fully open source web application designed for governments and NGOs who need a
flexible solution to **integrate and connect _any_ system**. It reuses our
existing tried and tested technology whilst lowering the technical barrier to
building robust workflow automation solutions and integrations through a more
intuitive, user-friendly UI.

**Read more about Lightning on our [docs page](documentation/about-lightning).**

_Note that at the time of writing, Lightning is still in beta and has some rough
edges. 95% of OpenFn users are still building workflow solutions on the v1
(available at [openfn.org](https://www.openfn.org/signup)) but we’ll be ready
for a full migration later this year._

## Register for an account and share your feedback

Register for a free account at
[app.openfn.org](https://app.openfn.org/users/register). Help us out by carrying
out our [user test](/blog#take-10-minutes-to-carry-out-our-user-test) (~10
minutes) and adding your questions and comments to the Lightning thread on our
community forum [ADD LINK].

## Take 10 minutes to carry out our user test

Get your thinking hat on! We need you to click around OpenFn Lightning and
figure out how it works.

** 1. Start recording your screen, and speak out loud as you work through tasks
2 and 3.**

Use [Loom](https://www.loom.com/looms) to more easily share your recording - you
can create an account for free.

As you record, make sure to tell us:

- What you see
- What you’re doing
- What you’re thinking
- What you expect

For example, start off by saying “I’ve just started recoding my screen, and now
I’m going to start the first task. (…) I’ve registered for an account and I’ve
just been taken to the workflow page. I can see …”

** 2. Register / Login on
[app.openfn.org](https://app.openfn.org/users/register).**

Take 2 minutes to click around the app and view all of the different pages. As
you click into them, tell us where your attention is drawn and what you think
each page might be for.

** 3. Using the [quick-start guide](/documentation/build/lightning-quick-start),
figure out how OpenFn works and what you can do in the application.**

What are jobs, trigger and adaptors? How do you run a job? What is the input?

** 4. Now, in your own words, explain to someone how to build a workflow.**

What is a workflow and how do I build one?

Why is OpenFn useful? What might discourage you from using it?

** 5. Send the recording to our product manager Amber at amber@openfn.org.**

_•Note: the recording will only be used internally. If you wish for it to be
deleted once viewed please state so in the email._

If you would rather give your feedback in person, or have questions around using
Lightning, please book office hours with our product manager Amber via the
