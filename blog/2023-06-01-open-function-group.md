The team behind OpenFn has secured a $2M investment from the
[Steele Foundation for Hope](https://www.steelefoundationforhope.org/) to help
us scale our impact.

> **tl;dr:** OpenFn, the open source
> [Digital Public Good](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/) (DPG),
> [Global Good for Health](https://digitalsquare.org/digital-health-global-goods),
> and increasingly important part of the digital public infrastructure that's
> relied on by governments and NGOs around the world, is now in a better
> position than ever to serve our growing community of global users.

What follows is a description of what the company behind it is doing and
why—specifically in terms of what it will mean for the future of the OpenFn DPG.

## Some context

<details>
  <summary>What is OpenFn?</summary>
  <div>
    OpenFn is workflow automation platform in use in over 40 countries by
    governments and social-sector organizations to automate critical business
    processes that run across multiple systems.

</details>

**Open Function Group** is a public benefit corporation and we are the primary
stewards of the OpenFn DPG. Historically, most of our revenue came from selling
software licenses and doing implementation work around a proprietary web
application built on top of the open-source OpenFn integration toolkit. We have
reinvested our earned revenue over the years into the development of this free
and open source (FOSS) toolkit. In recent years, since committing to making the
next version of our flagship product fully open-source, we’ve also received key
grants, donations, and pull requests to strengthen the toolkit and this next
version, OpenFn/Lightning, directly.

The **Steele Foundation for Hope** is a foundation that invests in lasting
solutions for some of humanity’s hardest challenges. They believe that advances
found through technology and innovation are key to improving quality of life for
less fortunate people around the world. They share our vision for a diverse,
thriving ICT4D sector with local ownership of solutions and distribution of
power, and we are incredibly excited to have their backing for this next stage
OpenFn’s growth.

## What we're doing

Making our flagship product fully open-source is important to our long-term
strategy for impact at scale. Even when governments and NGOs choose a managed
OpenFn offering, they need to know that they're not locked in. They've got to
own their solution, and that means having the substantive freedom to implement,
deploy, run, maintain, or easily migrate off OpenFn when and however they want.

At the same time, customers running critical workflows on OpenFn only chose our
technology in the first place because they're confident that it's well built,
well maintained, and isn't going anywhere anytime soon. In other words, they
want robust software that's supported by reliable businesses—in that sense, they
do not want us to do anything that might threaten the long-term sustainability
of the company that built it.

Donor funding to enhance our open source software and documentation has been
absolutely pivotal to date, and we’ll continue to receive grant funding for
this, **but the investment from the Steele Foundation allows us to do something
different.** It allows us to expand key aspects of our _business_ that may
ultimately help us reduce our reliance on donors and drastically expand the
social impact of the free and open source digital public good we provide.

Two major initiatives that are already underway are a UX redesign focused on
new-user onboarding and the development of a new channel partner certification
program. Through the latter, we've seen staff at two different partner
organizations get certified and one has gone on to deliver an OpenFn
implementation with the Ministry of Health in St. Lucia, automating a vaccine
reporting workflow involving DHIS2 and a custom ministry database.

## What this means for the DPG

So what does an investment in Open Function Group mean for the future of the
OpenFn DPG?

First, it means we have the ability to set and execute on a longer-term strategy
for the product—one that we feel will allow the impact of the DPG to grow
exponentially by decoupling adoption from the growth of our own core team. A
large portion of this investment will go directly into the design and
implementation of features in the Lightning code base, made in conversation with
our open-source steering committee for the immediate benefit of the whole
community.

Second, we'll be able to back up that new product strategy with serious capacity
building and business generation initiatives that grow the implementer
network—this means that there will be more capable OpenFn implementers within
governments, NGOs, and for-profit consultancies all over the world.

Finally, as we iterate on and improve our software-delivery-as-a-service
(hosting, deployment, maintenance, support) model, we’ll achieve greater
financial stability, safeguarding the continued development of the DPG for years
to come.

## One more thing

This is a significant moment for the OpenFn community. On behalf of the team at
Open Function Group, I want to thank all of our users, contributors,
implementers, and partners. Your work, and the hope that you put in ICT4D is why
we're doing what we're doing.

Whether you're a longtime forum user or are yet to make you first post on
[community.openfn.org](https://community.openfn.org), now is the perfect time to
make some noise.

- Ask a question about the data model. (Or the business model!)
- Share about or get advice on your upcoming implementations.
- Ask about the open source steering committee.
- Request a new feature for Lightning.
- Learn how to build new adaptors.
- Report a bug.
- Tell us why you love OpenFn or what you hate about it. (OpenFn is only here
  because of _you_ and the importance of your work.)

Your use cases, workflows, adaptors, features, frustrations, feelings of
delight... they have driven the product forward for the last 9 years and we
can’t tell you how grateful we are for your continued support and willingness to
contribute. Thank you.

— Taylor
