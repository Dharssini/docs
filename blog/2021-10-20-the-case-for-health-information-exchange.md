I attended the OpenHIE Academy Live Event last week and learned about the
function and application of the OpenHIE Architecture framework and its
components. What's a health information exchange, and what does it mean for
people in everyday terms?

A health information exchange allows for health data to be entered once and
reused across different systems by defining standards and communication
protocols that enable many systems to work with the same data.

We can imagine various real world use cases for implementing a health
information exchange architecture. My cousin Mariam’s experience with healthcare
in Conakry serves as an example. After visiting three clinics and hospitals in
Conakry, Mariam was diagnosed with kidney stones at the fourth one. All of the
data that was collected in the first three clinics were not accessible to Dr.
Kaba at the fourth one. At each clinic the same data was collected and doctors
relied on Mariam to provide her medical history. They asked about past visits,
previous diagnoses, prescriptions, lab results, etc. Her medical history was
spread across paper and electronic systems, in her home, at different
pharmacies, and in labs. Imagine how much faster she could have been diagnosed
and treated if her healthcare workers had access to a comprehensive view of her
medical history.

A health information exchange would mitigate these issues and allow data to be
stored in a single database. All authorized stakeholders would be able to access
and update this single health record and Mariam wouldn’t need to stress about
her paper prescription she lost from years ago. **Patient data is only one piece
of the puzzle and other important health data such as information on facilities,
providers, and supplies can also be managed in the health information exchange
system.**

### OpenFn's Role

Two key components of a health information exchange are **interoperability and
data standards.** The OpenFn Integration Toolkit is a tool for interoperability
solution design, implementation, and adherence to data standards in health
information exchange–key for organizations seeking to securely increase
interoperability across systems and partners, reduce costs, strengthen health
systems, and improve service delivery. Released this year, the Toolkit is a
digital global good that helps health and humanitarian organizations and
governments automate key processes and integrate critical information systems.
It was developed in partnership with 45+ social sector partners, incorporating
resources and learnings from dozens of implementations to deliver a suite of
open-source documentation, implementation tools, and a templates library that
fast-tracks interoperability and automation projects.
