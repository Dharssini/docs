Over the past 12 months, [OpenFn](https://openfn.org/) and
[UNICEF Cambodia](https://www.unicef.org/cambodia/) have worked together to
enhance interoperability for the critical software tools Cambodian agencies rely
on to protect and respond to the needs of vulnerable children and women. Key
outcomes achieved so far via this partnership include the implementation of a
secure OpenFn project space with the automated data sharing workflows required
to allow for the Cambodian government and their partner NGO caseworkers to
communicate with one another seamlessly.

Case management applications help social service providers coordinate critical
support activities for vulnerable children; ensuring that they can securely
connect with one another and automating the flow of data between themshare and
the launch of these integration features is especially important amidst an
increase in the rates of domestic and gender based violence linked to the
COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the secure workflows the automation
allows—critically, facilitating the complex referral process—brings the child
protection system in Cambodia one step closer to the collective dream of
providing holistic, compassionate care.

### The Key Partners

The Child Protection team at UNICEF Cambodia, working in concert with the
country’s Child Welfare Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans
and Youth Rehabilitation (MoSVY) defined the scope of the interoperability
requirements and guided this program’s implementation. Because achieving
interoperability can be complex, OpenFn was brought into the consortium to offer
expert integration insights and to provide the digital infrastructure required
to enable the program’s goals.

### The Systems Integrated

The systems OpenFn integrated for the first phase of this project are
[Primero](https://www.primero.org/) and [OSCaR](https://oscarhq.com/). Primero
is an open source software platform that helps social services, humanitarian and
development workers manage protection-related data, with modules that facilitate
case management, incident monitoring and family tracing and reunification. OSCaR
(Open Source Case-management and Record-keeping) is a case management software
system that is used by civil society organizations in Cambodia to manage cases
or children in residential care.

First a definition: “Interoperability”, in this context, is the automated
ability of computer systems to work in concert with (sharing data and
collaborating on processes with) other systems. Defining interoperability is the
easy part; achieving it is another story. “In a complex, interagency project
like this, it’s true that the technologies in play often don’t ‘speak the same
language’, but neither do the partners,” writes Aleksa Krolls, OpenFn’s Head of
Services. “Our job is not only to facilitate the flow of data between systems,
but to facilitate the process by which our partners—human users—communicate
meaning across multiple agencies and people.”

In this example, OpenFn’s software is acting as the “translator” between the
OSCaR and Primero systems. OpenFn’s primary interoperability objective for this
first phase was to facilitate Cambodian government partners and local
non-governmental organizations in systematic registration and tracking of
children in Cambodia, including facilitating duplicate detection between systems
and enabling easy-to-use processes for updating beneficiary/client details.

### The work is just beginning

OpenFn’s work with UNICEF Cambodia and the MoSVY doesn’t end here though. We are
now beginning the process of enabling further Primero interoperability with
software like ProGres v2, UNHCR’s institutional tool, as well as enabling
Primero-to-Primero implementations in the field. We’ll be sure to keep the
community updated as the project progresses.

Many of the best responses to the critical issues we face as a society emerge
from collaboration and interoperability enables collaboration in the digital
domain. Just as no single actor or organization can deliver all the services
required to protect vulnerable children and survivors of violence, no single
technology can be successful operating in isolation.

Case management automation allows for a social worker to spend more time being
there for the vulnerable populations they serve and less time copying and
pasting data between the applications they use. This partnership between OpenFn,
UNICEF Cambodia and the MoSVY means that fewer children will need to painfully
re-tell their traumas just to receive the help they need.
