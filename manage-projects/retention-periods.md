title: History Retention
---

In the "Data Storage" section, you can configure how long you'd like your run
history to be stored for a particular project.

:::tip

Note that when running Lightning on OpenFn.org, a project's plan may limit how
long we'll store your history. You can always store less, but paid plans get
longer storage.

:::

### What is history?

History includes work orders, runs, logs, and any associated input/output
dataclips.

### Why would I want to reduce my history retention period for a project?

Some project administrators chose to store history for a shorter duration (a
month or 90-days) to reduce data storage costs or to limit their data footprint.

### What happens when old work orders, runs, logs, or dataclips get removed?

If you've configured any automatic data exports or archiving, you can still
access your history in those CSVs, but all history will be removed from the
OpenFn platform.
