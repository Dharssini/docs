This means our prime directive is to move data quickly and securely between different software systems. In most cases:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA source application sends \nmessages\n to your project\u2019s \ninbox\n when something happens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJobs\n will be triggered, based on your \nfilters\n, and use the data in those messages to attempt specific actions in destination systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nlogs\n are recorded so you can see precisely what happened and when and where it happened to take action in the event of a failed attempt\u2014like editing the job or even the source message and trying it again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho uses OpenFn?\n#\n\n\nOpenFn is used by organizations big and small, but the individuals interacting with the platform range from system administrators to Javascript developers. With a basic understanding of Javascript, the flexibility of the platform is almost limitless.\n\n\nIs OpenFn open-source?\n#\n\n\nOpenFn has built and maintains dozens of open-source data transformation and API wrapper software packages. They are licensed under the \nLGPL\n and can be used freely to extract, transform, and load data from a command line, or as part of another software application.\n\n\nOpenFn also hosts a proprietary web-application that ties these tools together (www.openfn.org) into an out-of-the-box integration management platform.\n\n\nHow reliable is the hosted service?\n#\n\n\nOpenFn has harnessed the extreme stability and scalability of Erlang to coordinate these actions and provide users with email alerts, project management tools, and an online job writing IDE.\n\n\nWe constantly monitor our own status with independent infrastructure at \nstatus.openfn.org\n.\n\n\nWe've been delivering this service continuously for over two years now.",

            "text": "Open Function Documentation\n#\n\n\nQuick-start guide\n#\n\n\n1. Create your account.\n If you haven't already, create an account at \nOpenFn.org\n\n\n2. Log In.\n After logging into your new account, you will see an overview of your current projects and the job runs associated with that project. This is called the outer \nDashboard\n. Click on one project to start.\n\n\n3. Review the navigation bar.\n You should now be looking at the OpenFn User dashboard for a particular project. Review the following navigation tabs:\n\nJobs\n | \nTriggers\n | \nCredentials\n | \nInbox\n | \nRun History\n | \nVersion Control\n | \nAccess \n Security\n | \nProject Settings\n\n\n\n\nJobs.\n A job defines the specific series of tasks or database actions to be performed when a triggering message is received or a timer interval has elapsed. Jobs are like the \u201cinstructions\u201d you might give a data entry staff member (e.g., create new Patient record in the database, send SMS with payment confirmation number, etc.).\n\n\nTriggers.\n A trigger runs jobs based on events, including incoming messages (this is known as a \u201cmessage filter\u201d) or on a timer (a \u201ctime trigger\u201d).\n\n\nCredentials.\n A credential is used to authorize connection to a destination system (e.g., Salesforce username, password \n login URL).\n\n\nInbox.\n Your inbox contains the history of all messages that have passed in to your project, which may or may not have triggered a specific job. Messages are stored payloads or data (e.g., an incoming SMS, a submitted CommCare form) that were sent via HTTP post to your inbox.\n\n\nRun History.\n Runs are OpenFn attempts made on a destination system by running a message through a job. Runs can be viewed here and re-processed if there were any errors flagged when running a job.\n\n\nVersion Control.\n Sync your project with a GitHub repository so that every change is tracked using git and jobs can be 'rolled back' to previous commits at the touch of a button.\n\n\nAccess \n Security.\n - Invite other OpenFn users to collaborate with you on your project and create authentication methods for your project to restrict which applications can send data to your inbox.\n\n\nSettings.\n Monitor your usage and update your project settings here.\n\n\n\n\n4. Check your inbox.\n Click on the Inbox tab to view messages -- receipts of data that was sent to your project inbox. Click on the Inbox tab.\n\n\n5. Run a job.\n You should see your first message associated with a \"sample job\". Click on it. You can now choose to do the following:\n\n\n\n\nEdit the message (mainly for the purpose of fixing mistakes in data),\n\n\nManually run the job associated with a filter which has identified your first message as a trigger. See the \nCurrent Potential\n section for all jobs that can be run against this message based on their triggers and the message body.\n\n\n\n\nClick run.\n\n\n6. View the Associated Runs.\n After running the job, view the run logs in this section below.\n- Click into a run to see what happened to the data inside of the message. In the logs, you should be able to see the status (success/error) of the run.\n- Go to the \"Run History\" navigation tab to also view every job run log and its status.\n\n\n7. Familiarize yourself with the other tabs.\n\n\nNavigate to \nTriggers\n. You can see that the sample filter we provided you required a message to be sent from OpenFn in order to trigger a job run. Click on the filter to edit it. Click save when you are done.\n\n\nNavigate to \nJobs\n. Here you can:\n\n\n\n\nYou can click to view the job that was run when triggered by the sample filter and sample message.\n\n\nClick on \"Edit Job\" to edit the .js file which executes a specific action (job).\n\n\nClick on the specified filter to change which filter should trigger that job.\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to \nCredentials\n to edit the destination system you want to connect to. By default, we have provided credentials to access the Salesforce sandbox environment.\n\n\nNavigate to the \nSettings\n tab to change the project's name, upgrade your account for more jobs and runs, add collaborators, and transfer project ownership.\n\n\nConnecting Source Applications\n#\n\n\nMost modern web applications have a feature that allows you to \npush\n, \npublish\n, or \npost\n data to another URL when a certain \nevent\n takes place. This event could be a form submission, mobile payment, patient registration, or barcode scan submission from a mobile app. The key is that your source application will notify OpenFn when \nsomething happens\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to the \"settings\" or \"administration\" page for your source app, and look for a \nWebhook API\n, \nData Forwarding API\n, or \nNotifications API\n. Write to the developers of your application if none is provided out of the box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen setting up forwarding, select to send messages in \nJSON\n to your project's \ninbox URL\n. This is a UUID that serves as your API token. You can find and copy your secure inbox URL by clicking on the \"copy URL\" link in the bottom-right corner of the project in question on your \nproject dashboard\n page or by using the \"Copy URL\" button on your project's \"Inbox\" page..\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoon you'll see new messages arrive in your \nInbox\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a compatible notifications service\n#\n\n\nIf you are a developer, looking to set up a compatible notifications API for OpenFn, please see our \nApplication Developers\n section.\n\n\nTriggers\n#\n\n\nTriggers run jobs. They can either be \"filter\" triggers or \"timer\" triggers. Filter triggers watch incoming messages and run them through jobs when they match the filter criteria. Timer triggers run jobs after a recurring interval has elapsed.\n\n\nYou, as a user, specify the filter \ncriteria\n which determines which messages in your inbox should trigger job runs. This means that if any segment of a message body \nmatches\n the string of \nJSON\n you gave as a filter, the filter will run and trigger a job (assuming you created one).\n\n\nThe filter criteria takes the form of a string of valid \nJSON\n. In a SQL query, this string will be used in the WHERE clause, for example:\n\n\nSELECT\n \n*\n \nFROM\n \nreceipts\n\n  \nWHERE\n \nbody\n::\njsonb\n \n@\n\n    \n{\nName\n:\nAleksa Iwobi\n}\n::\njsonb\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter Matching\n#\n\n\nTo illustrate filter matching, refer to the \nJSON\n strings below. Message \"a\" will match filter '1', but message \"b\" will not.\n\n\nFilter 1:\n#\n\n\n{\nformID\n:\npatient_registration_v7\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage a (MATCH):\n#\n\n\n{\nsubmissionDate\n:\n2016-01-15\n,\n \nformID\n:\npatient_registration_v7\n,\n \nname\n:\nJack Wilshere\n,\n \ndob\n:\n1986-05-16\n,\n \nmedications\n:\n \n[\nanaphlene\n,\nzaradood\n,\nmorphofast\n]}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage b (NO MATCH):\n#\n\n\n{\nsubmissionDate\n:\n2016-01-16\n,\n \nformID\n:\npatient_registration_v8\n,\n \nname\n:\nLarry Bird\n,\n \ndob\n:\n1982-03-21\n,\n \nmedications\n:\n \n[\nanaphlene\n,\nzaradood\n,\nmorphofast\n]}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage 'b' does not include \n\"formID\":\"patient_registration_v7\"\n and will not match filter '1'.\n\n\nCredentials\n#\n\n\nCredentials are used to authorize connections to destination systems. In the future, our adaptors will use credentials to fetch meta-data from source and destination applications and make the job writing process easier.\n\n\nSome systems (Salesforce, OpenMRS, DHIS2) require an instanceUrl, host, or ApiUrl. Leave off the final \"/\" in these Urls:\n\nhttps://login.salesforce.com\n or \nhttp://demo.openmrs.org/openmrs\n or \nhttps://play.dhis2.org\n.\n\n\nCredentials can only be viewed, or edited by a single user \u2014 their \"owner\" (or the person that created that credential). All the collaborators on a particular project can choose those credentials for use when defining a job.\n\n\nJobs\n#\n\n\nA job defines the specific series of tasks or database actions to be performed when a triggering message is received or a timer interval has elapsed.\n\n\nComposing Job Expressions\n#\n\n\nIn most cases, a job expression is a series of \ncreate\n or \nupsert\n actions that are run after a message arrives, using data from that message. It could look like this:\n\n\ncreate\n(\nPatient__c\n,\n \nfields\n(\n\n  \nfield\n(\nName\n,\n \ndataValue\n(\nform.surname\n)),\n\n  \nfield\n(\nAge__c\n,\n \n7\n)\n\n\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat would create a new \nPatient__c\n in some other system. The patient's \nName\n will be determined by the triggering message (the value inside \nform.surname\n, specifically) and the patient's \nAge__c\n will \nalways\n be 7. See how we hard coded it?\n\n\nWhat you see above is OpenFn's own syntax, and you've got access to dozens of common \"helper functions\" like \ndataValue(path)\n and destination specific functions like \ncreate(object,attributes)\n. While most cases are covered out-of-the-box, jobs are \nevaluated as Javascript\n. This means that you can write your own custom, anonymous functions to do whatever your heart desires:\n\n\ncreate\n(\nPatient__c\n,\n \nfields\n(\n\n  \nfield\n(\nName\n,\n \nfunction\n(\nstate\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \nArray\n.\napply\n(\n\n      \nnull\n,\n \ndataValue\n(\npatient_names\n)(\nstate\n)\n\n    \n).\njoin\n(\n, \n)\n\n  \n})\n\n  \nfield\n(\nAge__c\n,\n \n7\n)\n\n\n));\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, the patient's name will be a comma separated concatenation of all the values in the \npatient_names\n array from our source message.\n\n\nAvailable Javascript Globals\n#\n\n\nFor security reasons, users start with access to the following standard Javascript globals, and can request more by opening an issue on Github:\n\n\n\n\nArray\n\n\nconsole\n\n\nJSON\n\n\nNumber\n\n\nPromise\n\n\nString\n\n\n\n\n*N.B. The runtime environment on the server is Node v6.5.0.\n\n\nOther than the expression tree, Jobs have certain attributes that must be set:\n\n\n\n\nFilter\n - The message filter that will triggers the job.\n\n\nAdaptor\n - The adaptor for the destination system you're connecting to.\n\n\nCredential\n - The credential that will be used to gain access to that destination system.\n\n\nActive?\n - A boolean which determines whether the job runs in real-time when matching messages arrive.\n\n\n\n\nSelected Named Functions\n#\n\n\nThere are lots more available in the language-packs.\n\n\nlanguage-common\n#\n\n\n\n\nfield('destination_field_name__c', 'value')\n Returns a key, value pair in an array. \n(source)\n\n\nfields(list_of_fields)\n zips key value pairs into an object. \n(source)\n\n\ndataValue('JSON_path')\n Picks out a single value from source data. \n(source)\n\n\neach(JSON_path, operation(...))\n Scopes an array of data based on a JSONPath \n(source)\n. See beta.each when using multiple each()'s in an expression.\n\n\neach(merge(dataPath(\"CHILD_ARRAY[*]\"),fields(field(\"metaId\", dataValue(\"*meta-instance-id*\")),field(\"parentId\", lastReferenceValue(\"id\")))), create(...))\n merges data into an array then creates for each item in the array \n(source)\n\n\nlastReferenceValue('id')\n gets the sfID of the last item created \n(source)\n\n\nfunction(state){return state.references[state.references.length-N].id})\n gets the sfID of the nth item created\n\n\n\n\nbeta.each(JSON_path, operation(...))\n#\n\n\nScopes an array of data based on a JSONPath but then returns to the state it was given upon completion \n(source)\n. This is necessary if you string multiple \neach(...)\n functions together in-line in the same expression. (E.g., Given data which has multiple separate 'repeat groups' in a form which are rendered as arrays, you want to create new records for each item inside the first repeat group, then \nRETURN TO THE TOP LEVEL\n of the data, and then create new records for each item in the second repeat group. Using \nbeta.each(...)\n lets you enter the first array, create your records, then return to the top level and be able to enter the second array.\n\n\nSalesforce\n#\n\n\n\n\ncreate(\"DEST_OBJECT_NAME__C\", fields(...))\n Create a new object. Takes 2 parameters: An object and attributes. \n(source)\n\n\nupsert(\"DEST_OBJECT_NAME__C\", \"DEST_OBJECT_EXTERNAL_ID__C\", fields(...))\n Creates or updates an object. Takes 3 paraneters: An object, an ID field and attributes. \n(source)\n\n\nrelationship(\"DEST_RELATIONSHIP_NAME__r\", \"EXTERNAL_ID_ON_RELATED_OBJECT__C\", \"SOURCE_DATA_OR_VALUE\")\n Adds a lookup or 'dome insert' to a record. \n(source)\n\n\n\n\ndhis2\n#\n\n\n\n\nevent(...)\n Creates an event. \n(source)\n\n\ndataValueSet(...)\n Send data values using the dataValueSets resource \n(source)\n\n\n\n\nOpenMRS\n#\n\n\n\n\nperson(...)\n Takes a payload of data to create a person \n(source)\n\n\npatient(...)\n Takes a payload of data to create a patient \n(source)\n\n\n\n\nFor code block examples of job expressions, go to the \nAppendix\n.\n\n\nInbox\n#\n\n\nYour inbox contains the history of all messages that have passed in to your project, which may or may not have triggered a specific job. Messages are stored payloads or data that were sent via HTTP post to your inbox. They can be viewed in formatted JSON, edited, or manually processed (if they did not match a filter when they were originally delivered.)\n\n\nTo edit a message, click the \"pencil and paper\" icon next to that receipt. Be careful, as no original copy will be persisted.\n\n\nActivity\n#\n\n\nIn this section of the portal, you can view a list of all \"runs\" - i.e. individual job runs. This list is essentially a compilation of all jobs, messages and credentials flowing through your OpenFn account towards your destination system(s).\n\n\nRuns\n#\n\n\nRuns are attempts made on a destination system by running a receipt through a Job Description. Runs can be viewed and re-processed. Each submission has a \nsuccess\n, \nstarted_at\n, \nfinsihed_at\n, \njob_description_id\n, and \nreceipt_id\n attribute. \nStarted_at\n and \nfinished_at\n are the timestamps when the submission began and ended.\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Some runs may take a really long time, particularly if they are performing multiple actions in a destination system or if they are fetching lots of data from a REST api at the start of a migration. They will appear as red if they have failed. In the case of failure, refer to our \nTroubleshooting\n section below.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n#\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if my survey data from ODK needs to link to existing records in my Salesforce system but a respondent enters or selects an invalid \nexternal ID\n?\n\n\n\n\nGreat question, and don't worry, it happens all the time. Assuming you've already taken all possible measures to either pre-load external IDs in your ODK form or use more human-proof IDs (like barcodes and fingerprints) here's the flow of work:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the email, and inspect the reason for failure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n99% of failed runs on OpenFn are due to \nvalue mismatches\n. The \ncollected\n \nid\n in ODK doesn't match the \nexpected\n \nid\n in Salesforce. You must now chose to either:\n\n\nA. Edit the source \nid\n in your \nreceipt\n \n retry the attempt.\n\n\nB. Edit the related \nid\n in your destination system \n retry the attempt.\n\n\nC. Ignore the attempt\u2014this source data will never reach your destination system. (There have been reports of ODK Aggregate's JSON publisher sending dupliate values. If that happens and your run fails due to \"duplicate values\" on a particular unique field you can safely ignore the run in OpenFn.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditing data in your destination system can be done through that system's interface. Many tools that act as \nsources\n (like ODK) do not allow for easy editing and re-submission of data. You can use OpenFn to edit the source data before retrying the attempt.\n\n\nCommon Error Messages\n#\n\n\nThe most common error messages with English explanations are:\n\n\n\n\nDUPLICATE_VALUE: duplicate value found: ODK_uuid__c duplicates value on record with id: a0524000005wNw0\n - The insert is blocked because you are attempting to create a new record with a unique field with the same value as an existing record.\n\n\nRequired value missing\n\n\nExternalId not found\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n#\n\n\nOpenFn's core ETL tools are all open-source, and here we will explain how those tools can be used to perform ETL operations from your command line. You can even take this further and wrap them together in your own hosted service!\n\n\nTo create an integration service like OpenFn.org, you will need to build a REST endpoint that allows JSON or XML to be posted to it, returning a \n2XX\n and checking the body of that message to see if it matches some criteria. If the criteria match for that message, you must perform \nexecute\n from fn-lang, using the message data and some stored configuration as state. See a sample state.json below:\n\n\nState.json\n#\n\n\n{\n\n    \ndata\n:\n \n{\n\n      \nword_count\n:\n \n284\n,\n\n      \nlast_update\n:\n \n2016-11-10 13:58:47\n,\n\n      \nfolder_name\n:\n \nCivil Disobedience\n,\n\n      \nfile_owner\n:\n \nstudent@school.org.za\n,\n\n      \nfile_name\n:\n \nMock Journal Article\n\n    \n},\n\n    \nconfiguration\n:\n \n{\n\n      \nhost\n:\n \n109.XXX.11X.2XX\n,\n\n      \nport\n:\n \n5432\n,\n\n      \ndatabase\n:\n \ndata-warehouse\n,\n\n      \nuser\n:\n \npostgres\n,\n\n      \npassword\n:\n \nsecret-password\n,\n\n      \nssl\n:\n \ntrue\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure to store your logs. If you'd like to be able to retry transactions, persist the message data and provide an interface for manipulating that data by hand, or re-running certain transactions after the job expression has been altered.\n\n\nMake sure that a single inbound message can kick off the running of multiple jobs.\n\n\nTo get started, or just run fn-lang manually, from your command line, check out \nopenfn-devtools\n. With windows and linux install scripts, it's the fastest way to get up and running with OpenFn on your local machine.\n\n\nAppendix\n#\n\n\nSample code for DIY section\n#\n\n\nBelow you can find

After logging into your new account, you will see an overview of your current projects and the job runs associated with that project. This is called the outer  Dashboard . Click on one project to start.  3. Review the navigation bar.  You should now be looking at the OpenFn User dashboard for a particular project. Review the following navigation tabs: Jobs  |  Triggers  |  Credentials  |  Inbox  |  Run History  |  Version Control  |  Access   Security  |  Project Settings   Jobs.  A job defines the specific series of tasks or database actions to be performed when a triggering message is received or a timer interval has elapsed. Jobs are like the \u201cinstructions\u201d you might give a data entry staff member (e.g., create new Patient record in the database, send SMS with payment confirmation number, etc.).  Triggers.  A trigger runs jobs based on events, including incoming messages (this is known as a \u201cmessage filter\u201d) or on a timer (a \u201ctime trigger\u201d).  Credentials.  A credential is used to authorize connection to a destination system (e.g., Salesforce username, password   login URL).  Inbox.  Your inbox contains the history of all messages that have passed in to your project, which may or may not have triggered a specific job. Messages are stored payloads or data (e.g., an incoming SMS, a submitted CommCare form) that were sent via HTTP post to your inbox.  Run History.  Runs are OpenFn attempts made on a destination system by running a message through a job. Runs can be viewed here and re-processed if there were any errors flagged when running a job.  Version Control.  Sync your project with a GitHub repository so that every change is tracked using git and jobs can be 'rolled back' to previous commits at the touch of a button.  Access   Security.  - Invite other OpenFn users to collaborate with you on your project and create authentication methods for your project to restrict which applications can send data to your inbox.  Settings.  Monitor your usage and update your project settings here.   4. Check your inbox.  Click on the Inbox tab to view messages -- receipts of data that was sent to your project inbox. Click on the Inbox tab.  5. Run a job.  You should see your first message associated with a \"sample job\". Click on it. You can now choose to do the following:   Edit the message (mainly for the purpose of fixing mistakes in data),  Manually run the job associated with a filter which has identified your first message as a trigger. See the  Current Potential  section for all jobs that can be run against this message based on their triggers and the message body.   Click run.  6. View the Associated Runs.  After running the job, view the run logs in this section below.\n- Click into a run to see what happened to the data inside of the message. In the logs, you should be able to see the status (success/error) of the run.\n- Go to the \"Run History\" navigation tab to also view every job run log and its status.  7. Familiarize yourself with the other tabs.  Navigate to  Triggers . You can see that the sample filter we provided you required a message to be sent from OpenFn in order to trigger a job run. Click on the filter to edit it. Click save when you are done.  Navigate to  Jobs . Here you can:   You can click to view the job that was run when triggered by the sample filter and sample message.  Click on \"Edit Job\" to edit the .js file which executes a specific action (job).  Click on the specified filter to change which filter should trigger that job.   Navigate to  Credentials  to edit the destination system you want to connect to. By default, we have provided credentials to access the Salesforce sandbox environment.

Click \"view archived jobs\" to see and restore old jobs.\n\n\nstatus.openfn.org\n: is now live, providing continual testing of key OpenFn services. We run both message-filter-based and timer-trigger-based jobs every five minutes to ensure availability, as well as measuring the round-trip time (in ms) that it takes for a server in a different geographical location to send valid JSON to OpenFn then receive and process the 200 response. (This time will vary according to the location of your servers, but it's important to note that we test the full round trip. Our servers typically send out 200s in about 5-6ms, but you can expect the round trip to complete in closer to 750ms.)\n\n\nVersion 1.4.0 (2016-09-26)\n#\n\n\nNew features:\n\n\n\n\nRun \"matches\" directly from your inbox view.\n\n\nAlways display the latest notification, dismiss to scroll back in time.\n\n\nLogin and signup server responses\n\n\n\n\nRun \"matches\" from inbox:\n Users can now run matches in a single click from their inbox, getting notifications that runs have successfully started without having to navigate to the Message Inspector page for a given message. Look for the blue \"play\" button next to each match. Simply click to start running that job with the message in question.\n\n\nLatest notifications:\n User notifications will now be displayed \nnewest-on-top\n and when there are multiple stacked notifications users will be... well... notified. Click the small \"x\" to dismiss the latest notification, moving backwards in time until all have been read.\n\n\nLogin/signup errors:\n Until now, invalid login messages and duplicate singup emails had been only displayed in your brower's logs. (That's our fault.) You'll now see a handy \"invalid credentials\" or \"email already registered\" message when trying to log in or sign up.\n\n\nVersion 1.3.0 (2016-09-20)\n#\n\n\n\n\nNew version of language-salesforce allows users to \nalterState\n with a custom function.\n\n\n\n\nalterState:\n \ndocumentation\n\n\nVersion 1.2.0 (2016-09-15)\n#\n\n\n\n\nUsers can now select specific adaptor versions for their jobs.\n\n\nJobs will \"auto-upgrade\" unless locked to a specific version.\n\n\n\n\nAdaptor versions:\n  This means that the code beneath your job, once saved with a specific adaptor version, will never change. This is an important step forward for the whole community, as it enables more rapid progress\u2014especially considering the growing number of outside contributors\u2014without risking introducing instability to existing jobs.\n\n\nEach new version of an adaptor will have release notes introducing the new features or changes to helper functions. To allow easy upgrades, we will still mandate that all new versions are backwards compatible.\n\n\nVersion 1.1.0 (2016-08-29)\n#\n\n\nNew features:\n\n\n\n\nUsers can now run jobs based on \ntimers\n as well as filters.\n\n\nUsers can now view logs for all runs, not just the most recent.\n\n\nJobs are \"aware\" of their last running state.\n\n\nget(...)\n and \npost(...)\n are now supported using the language-http adaptor, allowing users to make their own HTTP calls in jobs.\n\n\n\n\nTimer triggers:\n On the triggers tab, users can set the trigger type to \"timer\" and input a whole number of seconds for the \"interval\". Any \"active\" jobs associated with this trigger will run periodically after the interval elapses.\n\n\nView logs for all runs:\n By clicking on an individual run from either the Activity tab or the Message Inspector, users can view the full logs for that run, regardless of whether or not a more recent run took place with the same job and message.\n\n\nJob state:\n When a job runs based on a timer, not an incoming message, it will preserve it's state for the next run. This feature is commonly used by language packs like language-surveycto, language-odk, and others to create a \"cursor\" to offset or limit database queries.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, \nfetchSubmissions(...)\n in the language-surveycto adaptor takes three arguments: \nformId\n, \nafterDate\n, and \npostUrl\n. The first time this job runs it will only fetch submissions \nafter\n the \nafterDate\n. If any submissions are received, it will take the last submission from the array (by date) and persist it in the \njob_state\n as \nlastSubmissionDate\n. The next time this job runs, say, 300 seconds (5 minutes) later, it will ignore \nafterDate\n and instead fetch submissions after \nlastSubmissionDate\n. While this particular helper function is very abstract (it does this one thing well) it's possible to write a job that simply alters the final \"state\" before completing, passing whatever data you'd like from \nTHIS RUN\n to the \nNEXT RUN\n of the job.\n\n\n\n\nget(...) and post(...):\n Have a look at this complex job using language-http. See how it is possible to provide a query and a callback for \nget\n while \npost\n takes a url and a body object. At the end, the user is setting state.lastSubmissionDate to \nsubmissions[submissions.length-1].SubmissionDate\n.\n\n\nSee the functions themselves at \nlanguage-http\n.\n\n\nget\n(\nforms/data/wide/json/someForm\n,\n \n{\n\n  \nquery\n:\n \nfunction\n(\nstate\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \n{\n \ndate\n:\n \nstate\n.\nlastSubmissionDate\n \n||\n \nAug 29, 2016 4:44:26 PM\n}\n\n  \n},\n\n  \ncallback\n:\n \nfunction\n(\nstate\n)\n \n{\n\n    \n// Pick submissions out in order to avoid `post` overwriting `response`.\n\n    \nvar\n \nsubmissions\n \n=\n \nstate\n.\nresponse\n.\nbody\n;\n\n    \n// return submissions\n\n    \nreturn\n \nsubmissions\n.\nreduce\n(\nfunction\n(\nacc\n,\n \nitem\n)\n \n{\n\n        \n// tag submissions as part of the \nsomeForm\n form\n\n        \nitem\n.\nformId\n \n=\n \nsomeForm\n\n        \nreturn\n \nacc\n.\nthen\n(\n\n          \npost\n(\n\n            \nhttps://www.openfn.org/inbox/some-inbox-uuid\n,\n\n            \n{\n \nbody\n:\n \nitem\n \n}\n\n          \n)\n\n        \n)\n\n      \n},\n \nPromise\n.\nresolve\n(\nstate\n))\n\n      \n.\nthen\n(\nfunction\n(\nstate\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nif\n \n(\nsubmissions\n.\nlength\n)\n \n{\n\n          \nstate\n.\nlastSubmissionDate\n \n=\n \nsubmissions\n[\nsubmissions\n.\nlength\n-\n1\n].\nSubmissionDate\n\n        \n}\n\n        \nreturn\n \nstate\n;\n\n      \n})\n\n      \n.\nthen\n(\nfunction\n(\nstate\n)\n \n{\n\n        \ndelete\n \nstate\n.\nresponse\n\n        \nreturn\n \nstate\n;\n\n      \n})\n\n  \n}\n\n\n})",

            "text": "New features:   Users can now run jobs based on  timers  as well as filters.  Users can now view logs for all runs, not just the most recent.  Jobs are \"aware\" of their last running state.  get(...)  and  post(...)  are now supported using the language-http adaptor, allowing users to make their own HTTP calls in jobs.   Timer triggers:  On the triggers tab, users can set the trigger type to \"timer\" and input a whole number of seconds for the \"interval\". Any \"active\" jobs associated with this trigger will run periodically after the interval elapses.  View logs for all runs:  By clicking on an individual run from either the Activity tab or the Message Inspector, users can view the full logs for that run, regardless of whether or not a more recent run took place with the same job and message.  Job state:  When a job runs based on a timer, not an incoming message, it will preserve it's state for the next run. This feature is commonly used by language packs like language-surveycto, language-odk, and others to create a \"cursor\" to offset or limit database queries.   For example,  fetchSubmissions(...)  in the language-surveycto adaptor takes three arguments:  formId ,  afterDate , and  postUrl . The first time this job runs it will only fetch submissions  after  the  afterDate . If any submissions are received, it will take the last submission from the array (by date) and persist it in the  job_state  as  lastSubmissionDate . The next time this job runs, say, 300 seconds (5 minutes) later, it will ignore  afterDate  and instead fetch submissions after  lastSubmissionDate . While this particular helper function is very abstract (it does this one thing well) it's possible to write a job that simply alters the final \"state\" before completing, passing whatever data you'd like from  THIS RUN  to the  NEXT RUN  of the job.   get(...) and post(...):  Have a look at this complex job using language-http. See how it is possible to provide a query and a callback for  get  while  post  takes a url and a body object. At the end, the user is setting state.lastSubmissionDate to  submissions[submissions.length-1].SubmissionDate .  See the functions themselves at  language-http .  get ( forms/data/wide/json/someForm ,   { \n   query :   function ( state )   { \n     return   {   date :   state . lastSubmissionDate   ||   Aug 29, 2016 4:44:26 PM } \n   }, \n   callback :   function ( state )   { \n     // Pick submissions out in order to avoid `post` overwriting `response`. \n     var   submissions   =   state . response . body ; \n     // return submissions \n     return   submissions . reduce ( function ( acc ,   item )   { \n         // tag submissions as part of the  someForm  form \n         item . formId   =   someForm \n         return   acc . then ( \n           post ( \n             https://www.openfn.org/inbox/some-inbox-uuid , \n             {   body :   item   } \n           ) \n         ) \n       },   Promise . resolve ( state )) \n       . then ( function ( state )   { \n         if   ( submissions . length )   { \n           state . lastSubmissionDate   =   submissions [ submissions . length - 1 ].

We follow modern web-standard JSON api guidelines.\n\n\nFor your application to a be data provider (or \"source\") for OpenFn integrations, we highly recommend that you create a \"notifications service\" (sometimes called a \"webhooks service\" or \"event-based push API\"). This is preferrable to using a REST api for two reasons: (1) A notifications service will give your clients the ability to set up real-time integrations, and (2) a notifications service is more efficient for both your servers and OpenFn\u2014instead of having requests be made and handled every X seconds, your servers and OpenFn's servers will only work when new data is available.\n\n\nFor your appliation to be a consumer (or \"destination\") for OpenFn, you must either have a standard, JSON-based rest API or create a language-package that meets your API specifications.\n\n\nSending data to OpenFn\n#\n\n\nTo send data to OpenFn, your application must be able to make an HTTPS post to an external URL with a valid JSON object as the post body. See the following example using cURL:\n\n\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -H \nContent-Type: application/json\n \\\n  -H \nCache-Control: no-cache\n \\\n  -d \n{\nfoo\n:\nbar\n, \nbaz\n:\nqux\n}\n \\\n  \nhttps://staging.openfn.org/inbox/some-secret-api-key\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenFn will respond with a 200 and an empty JSON object in the event of a successful post. 400s mean that the user's external URL is wrong, and 500s means that there is an application error on OpenFn. While 500s are rare, they could be due to invalid JSON in your POST body.\n\n\nIf you cannot notifiy an external URL when some event takes place, you can still integrate with OpenFn if you have a JSON-based REST API. OpenFn users can make HTTP GET requests to your application and perform additional actions based on your response. You should allow either basic or token authentication and responsd to a valid GET with JSON. There is no specific format for your response, as users can parse it any way they'd like, extracting relevant data and then performing other actions\u2014like loading it into a destination system\u2014with that data. See \nlanguage-http\n for details on how users make these generic HTTP requests.\n\n\nReceiving data from OpenFn\n#\n\n\nTo make it easy for users to connect to your application, it's highly recommended that you create a language-package with your required authentication and a set of simple, allowable actions nicely abstracted into \"helper functions\". See \nlanguage-dhis2\n for an example of a language-package which creates a simpler interface for a traditional JSON-based REST api. Language packages are written in Javascript and execute in Node. You can convert OpenFn's JSON into XML, or any other format before sending it to your application and you may make use of any node modules you'd like. See \nlanguage-postgresql\n for an example of a language package that connects directly to PostgreSQL databases using a popular NPM module called \"pg\".\n\n\nTo receive data from OpenFn's generic language-http langauge package, your application must allow either basic, token, or digest authenticated POST, PUT, or GET requests. (Though it is not advisable to create an API that requires GET requests to create or update data.)",

            "text": "This section is for you if you are hoping to build or extend an existing application that can connect to OpenFn. We follow modern web-standard JSON api guidelines.  For your application to a be data provider (or \"source\") for OpenFn integrations, we highly recommend that you create a \"notifications service\" (sometimes called a \"webhooks service\" or \"event-based push API\"). This is preferrable to using a REST api for two reasons: (1) A notifications service will give your clients the ability to set up real-time integrations, and (2) a notifications service is more efficient for both your servers and OpenFn\u2014instead of having requests be made and handled every X seconds, your servers and OpenFn's servers will only work when new data is available.  For your appliation to be a consumer (or \"destination\") for OpenFn, you must either have a standard, JSON-based rest API or create a language-package that meets your API specifications.",

            "text": "To send data to OpenFn, your application must be able to make an HTTPS post to an external URL with a valid JSON object as the post body. See the following example using cURL:  curl -X POST \\\n  -H  Content-Type: application/json  \\\n  -H  Cache-Control: no-cache  \\\n  -d  { foo : bar ,  baz : qux }  \\\n   https://staging.openfn.org/inbox/some-secret-api-key   OpenFn will respond with a 200 and an empty JSON object in the event of a successful post. 400s mean that the user's external URL is wrong, and 500s means that there is an application error on OpenFn. While 500s are rare, they could be due to invalid JSON in your POST body.  If you cannot notifiy an external URL when some event takes place, you can still integrate with OpenFn if you have a JSON-based REST API. OpenFn users can make HTTP GET requests to your application and perform additional actions based on your response. You should allow either basic or token authentication and responsd to a valid GET with JSON. There is no specific format for your response, as users can parse it any way they'd like, extracting relevant data and then performing other actions\u2014like loading it into a destination system\u2014with that data. See  language-http  for details on how users make these generic HTTP requests.",

See  language-dhis2  for an example of a language-package which creates a simpler interface for a traditional JSON-based REST api. Language packages are written in Javascript and execute in Node. You can convert OpenFn's JSON into XML, or any other format before sending it to your application and you may make use of any node modules you'd like. See  language-postgresql  for an example of a language package that connects directly to PostgreSQL databases using a popular NPM module called \"pg\".  To receive data from OpenFn's generic language-http langauge package, your application must allow either basic, token, or digest authenticated POST, PUT, or GET requests. (Though it is not advisable to create an API that requires GET requests to create or update data.)",
