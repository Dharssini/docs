So I enthusiastically agree.\\n\\nAnd I\u2019m not the only one. Between us, we have traveled 40,000 miles to be in\\nDistrict Six, Cape Town - from London, Dakar, Arusha, Riga, Nairobi. It has\\ntaken us over 150 hours to get here.\\n\\nRight now we are gathered around this table, in this hot little room, scribbling\\nour truths onto this oversized piece of paper. We are, in our own little way,\\ntrying to make the world a better place.\\n\\nSuddenly the fan stops, the lights go out, the projector goes dark.\\n\\nLoad shedding just struck.\\n\\nBut the conversation doesn\u2019t even waver. Eyes briefly flick to the light\\nfixtures, but we remain focused on refining our mission, putting an edge on our\\npurpose, comparing visions on how, where and when we can make a difference.\\n\\nWe have traveled all this way to figure out how to best work together.\\n\\nIf we don\u2019t get this right, we can\u2019t achieve our mission. We are digital nomads,\\nspread throughout Europe, Africa and North America. We rarely meet in physical\\nspace. Technology enables us to collaborate, but it brings its fair share of\\nchallenges too.\\n\\n\\"Sitting down all day is _dangerous_,\\" says Taylor. \\"We have to make this\\n_count_.\\"\\n\\nIt has taken weeks of preparation and worry to get here. I\u2019ve been arranging\\ntravel, visas, domestic stuff, vaccinations. Since covid broke out, for three\\nyears now, my partner and I have worked from home, in the same small flat,\\nalways together. I fight back tears as we kiss goodbye on the doorstep, and\\nstart my long journey.\\n\\n![Obligatory team photo](/img/team-cape-point.webp)\\n\\nIt\'s an overnight flight. I do not sleep. I hit Cape Town tarmac at 7am,\\nscrabble for a data connection at 8am, collapse into Stu\'s car at 9am. I watch\\nthe city, the townships, the shanty villages, the mountains; a new world drifts\\nsilently past the window. The environment is beautiful, the poverty is\\nheartbreaking.\\n\\nIn Simon\u2019s Town, as I shake hands with my colleagues for the first time, we\\nlearn things about each other that months of video conferencing could never\\nreveal.\\n\\nBy the end of the first day I am already exhausted, overwhelmed, burned out from\\nadrenaline.\\n\\nOver the weekend, we walk, we swim, we kick a football, we drive, we eat, we\\nimmerse ourselves in penguins (did you know Cape town has penguins?).\\n\\nAt an artistic retreat in Scarborough, we sculpt from clay, eyes closed, hands\\nbusy, minds focused. A safe space, our guide tells us nervously, unsure how to\\nbreak an ice that has suddenly formed in 30 degree heat.\\n\\nIt is at the same time austere and liberating, creative and claustrophobic,\\nindividual and collective. We swap chairs and work on each other\u2019s sculptures -\\nnervously, at first, unwilling to do harm, but soon embracing the opportunity to\\nco-imagine, to co-create.\\n\\nIn the end it is a joy from which, I think, we all emerged changed.\\n\\n\u201cIt was a little too woo-woo for me\u201d, says Taylor, tears still drying in his\\neyes. It is the most reassuring thing I have heard in days.\\n\\n![Taylor, laughing in the face of danger](/img/taylor-baboons.webp)\\n\\nLater, as the sun sets behind us, on a Cape Town beach, we share our stories.\\nBetween us we barely have a single thing in common - be it language, religion,\\neducation, gender, background, hobbies. But maybe, it emerges, there is one\\nthing - just one slender thread - which connects us after all: a determination\\nto fight inequality.\\n\\nWe are not righteous. We all know we can\u2019t save the world. We are not in the\\nbusiness of toppling regimes, redistributing wealth, healing the sick. We do not\\nbear torches.\\n\\nBut we do have a contribution to make. Automation is our thing. We believe that\\nwe can improve critical business processes in the \u201cdeveloping world\u201d - the\\nplaces that big tech doesn\u2019t care about - by taking away tedium, building trust\\nand transparency, and reducing errors.\\n\\nIn the office, unfazed by power cuts, we explore working practices, discuss\\ncultural differences, deepen our respect.\\n\\nWe learn how to talk about and discuss our data integration technology -\\nsomething so abstract that often even highly technical people don\u2019t get it. We\\nlearn how our technology helps the people Silicon Valley overlooks. We share\\nstories, explore ideas, learn about ourselves and the business.\\n\\nOn the penultimate day, I find myself overwhelmed with grief. Soon we depart to\\ndifferent corners of the world, vanish behind our screens. Yes, I miss my big\\nmonitor, my safe space, my family, my drinks cabinet, my PlayStation, my wok.\\nBut I know that this special, sacred shared time is ending - and later I will\\nmiss the company of my colleagues more than the comforts of home.\\n\\nSomewhere during this long pandemic, between fleeing an unsafe office and\\nthriving in isolation, I Iost something.

The [2019 Union Nations SDG Report](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/05/nature-decline-unprecedented-report/) found that as many as one million animal and plant species are in danger of extinction. Ergo, this also puts the people who highly depend on them at great risk. The earth\u2019s demolition statistics are alarming, with \u201cgreenhouse gas emissions [having] doubled, raising average global temperatures by at least 0.7 degrees Celsius.\u201d Less than 25% of the world can still be considered \u201cwilderness\u201d, urging that we must mitigate and avert these disasters without hesitation. Wilderness areas act as critical buffers against climate change, and as time goes on, these areas are diminishing due to global warming, leaving us vulnerable to climate disasters.\\n\\n### WCS works with multiple data platforms and dozens of partners worldwide and needs an integration solution to enable interoperability and scale.\\n\\nWith projects in nearly 60 countries and across oceans, WCS aims to re-establish a world where wildlife and people thrive in healthy lands and seas. WCS partners work on the frontline of conservation, ranging from Indigenous and local communities to national and local governments. Using mobile survey tools like [KoBo Toolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org), WCS field staff can complete and submit data collection forms to track the well-being of local communities they support, local governance, reforestation activities, natural resource use, and other conservation and social science research data. WCS sought out OpenFN to integrate its data collection sources with one database for centralised analysis of all this information.\\n\\n### OpenFn automates data pipelines from field to office, ensuring WCS decision-makers and researchers can access timely, accurate information. \\n\\nWCS implemented OpenFn to automate a standardised data flow between numerous wild meat consumption surveys and an MSSQL database to enable cross-partner data sharing and critical data analysis for a [\u20ac45 million initiative](https://newsroom.wcs.org/News-Releases/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/10598/New-45-million-initiative-seeks-to-curb-unsustainable-wildlife-hunting-conserve-biodiversity-and-improve-food-security.aspx). The initiative aims to curb unsustainable wildlife hunting, conserve biodiversity and improve food security.\\n\\nSince then, WCS has implemented OpenFn to support its partners from [Conservation Social Science Partnership](https://consosci.org/) (\u201cConSoSci\u201d). ConSoSci uses OpenFn to deploy and analyse research data collected in the field rapidly. One OpenFn solution auto-scans social science Kobo ToolBox surveys to then automatically:\\n1. Build [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [MSSQL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2019) databases and\\n2. Integrate the databases, making the field data quickly available for analysis and eliminating multiple manual configurations and data integration steps typically handled by a software engineer.\\n\\n![OpenFn integration](https://consosci.org/portals/0/ConSoSci%20Toolkit.png)\\n\\nOpenFn\u2019s solution saves ConSoSci partners time and money, enabling researchers to access reliable data from multiple sources more quickly and effectively. They can then analyse this information to help address critical gaps in social science capacity, implementation, and accessibility in conservation. \\n\\nThanks to the OpenFn Integration Toolkit, WCS has the digital infrastructure to efficiently scale its data collection, analysis, and sharing solutions to enhance interoperability across its programs and partners. OpenFn automatically syncs hundreds of records across dozens of WCS sites daily, enabling the WCS Conservation Technology Team to redirect its focus to its core work\u2013empowering researchers working to mitigate continued environmental damage. WCS believes that \u201cby discovering how to save nature, we can inspire the world to protect it\u201d, and OpenFn is committed to helping conservation stakeholders automate this discovery process worldwide.\\n\\nTo explore WCS and ConSoSci OpenFn solutions, check out the open-source code on Github (github.com/OpenFn/consosci). Next up for WCS are integrations between Kobo ToolBox and Asana. Stay tuned for more!\\n\\n### Call to Action\\nIf you have questions about our WCS partnership or integration toolkit, head to [community.openfn.org](https://community.openfn.org) to connect and talk to like-minded social-sector integrators and OpenFn staff.

My cousin Mariam\u2019s experience with healthcare\\nin Conakry serves as an example. After visiting three clinics and hospitals in\\nConakry, Mariam was diagnosed with kidney stones at the fourth one. All of the\\ndata that was collected in the first three clinics were not accessible to her\\ndoctor at the fourth one. At each clinic the same data was collected and doctors\\nrelied on Mariam to provide her medical history. They asked about past visits,\\nprevious diagnoses, prescriptions, lab results, etc. Her medical history was\\nspread across paper and electronic systems, in her home, at different\\npharmacies, and in labs. Imagine how much faster she could have been diagnosed\\nand treated if her healthcare workers had access to a comprehensive view of her\\nmedical history.\\n\\nA health information exchange would mitigate these issues and allow data to be\\nstored in a single database. All authorized stakeholders would be able to access\\nand update this single health record and Mariam wouldn\u2019t need to stress about\\nher paper prescription she lost from years ago. **Patient data is only one piece\\nof the puzzle and other important health data such as information on facilities,\\nproviders, and supplies can also be managed in the health information exchange\\nsystem.**\\n\\n### OpenFn\'s Role\\n\\nTwo key components of a health information exchange are **interoperability and\\ndata standards.** The OpenFn Integration Toolkit is a tool for interoperability\\nsolution design, implementation, and adherence to data standards in health\\ninformation exchange\u2013key for organizations seeking to securely increase\\ninteroperability across systems and partners, reduce costs, strengthen health\\nsystems, and improve service delivery.

In the Primero post\\nmentioned above, Jan Panchalingam, also a Child Protection Specialist at UNICEF,\\nwrites that implementing OpenFn is \u201cchanging the way they work\u201d.\\n\\nThe \u201caha\u201d moment for those involved in this project was that the artifacts\\nproduced in an OpenFn implementation\u2014actual\\n[\u201ctriggers\u201d](/documentation/build/triggers) and\\n[\u201cjobs\u201d](/documentation/build/jobs) written with and for the Open Source\\nIntegration Toolkit\u2014publicly memorialize the data sharing agreements between\\npartners.\\n\\nI want to stick with that for a moment: **the implementation _is_ the\\nagreement!**\\n\\n:::success\\n\\nBy **operationalizing a data sharing agreement** through OpenFn, these\\norganizations now have machine-readable granularity, full revision history, and\\nproof-of-processing for their contract.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nA huge portion of the work required to make the case management systems\\ninteroperable was done on calls, walking through different referral flows and\\nprivacy requirements and getting buy-in from various stakeholders and legal\\nentities. Now, the output of those crucial conversations are not just notes or a\\nsigned MOU and careful task lists for system admins, they are a series of\\nscripts that are stored and actually enacted, faithfully, automatically, and\\nmany times every day by the OpenFn platform\u2013automating data exchange between\\npartner agencies.\\n\\nBy implementing OpenFn\u2014defining the case referral process and the requirements\\nof the agreement in machine-readable levels of specificity\u2014they\u2019ve actually\\nremoved huge amounts of ambiguity and helped standardize the data sharing\\nagreements between partner ministries/organizations.\\n\\nAnd the reusability of these processes isn\u2019t just theoretical. They are already\\nbeing applied in three other big UNICEF implementations as we speak. The next to\\ngo live will be in Thailand.\\n\\nUNICEF and the Thai Ministry of Public Health are working to enable social\\nprotection caseworkers using the Primero app to access relevant patient medical\\nhistory securely, via OpenFn and a ministry-managed API gateway. By\\nforegrounding the checklist, and making sure all the stakeholders in these\\nsensitive data-sharing agreements are on board with the concept that this\\nimplementation is a way of formalizing and enforcing data sharing agreements,\\nthe teams have been able to move much more confidently through the initial\\nprototyping process. At OpenFn, we plan to continue to build out the open source\\nprocess documentation that goes alongside the software\u2014making it easier for\\nfolks everywhere to achieve durable interoperability and manifest their data\\nsharing agreements.\\n\\n### One more thing. On the subject of open source.\\n\\n**Open source is about freedom of choice, not money.**\\n\\nFor the moment, in both Cambodia and Thailand, the implementations are running\\non OpenFn.org\u2014our proprietary cloud-hosted service\u2014but in both cases they\u2019re\\nalready evaluating plans to migrate these implementations to make use of the\\nFOSS-only deployment pathway we provide in the Open Source Integration Toolkit.\\n\\nI think that\u2019s hugely important. A cloud-hosted service might be the best option\\nfor a given ministry during prototype, pilot, scale-up, or even national-scale\\ndeployments\u2014oftentimes they\u2019re less expensive and more secure\u2014<b><i>but for\\nsystems as important as these, it\u2019s absolutely critical that they\u2019re not locked\\nin.</i></b>\\n\\nGovernments must be free to export that implementation and run it on completely\\nopen source software that they can debug, on whatever servers they\u2019d like, with\\nsupport from whatever vendors they choose.\\n\\nThis is what recent investment in the Open Source Integration Toolkit, from\\nDigital Square, the FCDO, DIAL, and our team here at OpenFn has made possible.\\nFrom software, to documentation, to process and implementation guides like those\\nmentioned above, the goal of the toolkit is to build up the integration\\ncapability of the sector at large. Ultimately the toolkit will ensure that\\nOpenFn implementations aren\u2019t forever reliant on a single company. It will\\nincrease the substantive freedom of governments to make long-term plans and take\\nlong-term ownership of their integration solutions, without having to re-code\\nthe wheel.\\n\\n### To take action\\n\\nTo join our community please sign up to our\\n[community page ](https://community.openfn.org/)and feel free to contribute and\\nask questions on the forum.\\n\\nIf your organization is thinking about interoperability and would like to learn\\nmore about OpenFn\u2019s platform or open-source offerings please contact\\nservices@openfn.org for a free consultation.\\n\\nAlso, be sure to stay tuned to our [blog](/blog), or subscribe to our\\n[newsletter](http://eepurl.com/hcOw8H) to stay up to date with all ICT4D\\nintegration related news."},{"id":"/2021/03/30/digital-global-good","metadata":{"permalink":"/fr/blog/2021/03/30/digital-global-good","editUrl":"https://github.com/openfn/docs/edit/main/blog/2021-03-30-digital-global-good.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-03-30-digital-global-good.md","title":"Becoming a Digital Global Good, Open Access, and Thoughts on OpenFn\u2019s Long-Term Sustainability","description":"Digital global goods","date":"2021-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"30 mars 2021","tags":[{"label":"announcement","permalink":"/fr/blog/tags/announcement"},{"label":"global goods","permalink":"/fr/blog/tags/global-goods"}],"readingTime":6.865,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Taylor Downs and Jed Goldstein","url":"https://github.com/taylordowns2000","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/taylordowns2000"}],"frontMatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Becoming a Digital Global Good, Open Access, and Thoughts on OpenFn\u2019s Long-Term Sustainability","author":"Taylor Downs and Jed Goldstein","author_url":"https://github.com/taylordowns2000","author_image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/taylordowns2000","tags":["announcement","global goods"],"image":"/img/george-washington-bridge.jpg"},"prevItem":{"title":"Platforms, Processes and Legitimate Freedom at the National Government Level","permalink":"/fr/blog/2021/07/30/processes-and-open-source-as-choice"},"nextItem":{"title":"Enabling Interoperability for Child Case Referrals in Cambodia","permalink":"/fr/blog/2021/02/09/interoperability_for_case_referrals"}},"content":"[Digital global goods](https://wiki.digitalsquare.io/index.php/What_are_Global_Goods)\\nare adaptable, interoperable, open source software or content designed to meet\\nthe data and management needs of country health systems. Incredible software\\ntools like [CommCare](https://www.dimagi.com/commcare/), a mobile data\\ncollection and service delivery platform, [dhis2](https://dhis2.org/), a health\\nmanagement information system (HMIS) used in over 40 countries, and\\n[OpenLMIS](https://openlmis.org/), a popular logistics system, are digital\\nglobal goods. OpenFn is proud to now be officially joining them on this list.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n![Bridge as public good](/img/george-washington-bridge.jpg)\\n\\n### The imperative for digital global goods\\n\\nThe story of digital global goods began in July 2018 when the Secretary General\\nof the United Nations convened a High-Level Panel on Digital Cooperation to\\nstrengthen impact and better direct global efforts in the digital arena. What\\nmotivated this panel\u2019s formation was a growing awareness that as digital\\ntechnology reshapes economies and society, it is imperative that the\\ntechnologies deployed do not exacerbate global inequities, but instead seek to\\naddress them.\\n\\nCo-Chaired by Melinda Gates and Jack Ma, the panel\u2019s\\n[final report](https://digitalcooperation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DigitalCooperation-report-web-FINAL-1.pdf)\\nprovided recommendations for how the international community could work together\\nto harness digital technologies for positive change. One of the key action items\\nthat emerged in the report\u2019s aftermath was a call for global investment into the\\ncreation of **digital public goods to help attain the sustainable development\\ngoals. **Specifically, availability and accessibility to digital public\\ngoods\u2014and the data they collect\u2014was introduced as being essential to address\\nissues of digital inclusion for all regardless of location, race, gender,\\nreligion or socioeconomic standing.\\n\\n### What is open source?\\n\\nNot all open source projects are digital public goods, but all digital public\\ngoods must be open source. Open source software is code that is publicly\\naccessible\u2014anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit. Many\\ngovernments and international NGOs prefer open source software because of\\ncustomization and data residency requirements. Since our founding in 2014 OpenFn\\nhas been committed to open-source software development and the source code for\\nmost of the products we\u2019ve built is freely available on\\n[Github](https://github.com/OpenFn).\\n\\nNotably, even though open source software is \u201cfree\u201d the cost of deploying it and\\nmaintaining it carries costs that are sometimes comparable to commercial\\nsoftware licenses.\\n[Digital Square ](https://digitalsquare.org/blog/2020/2/13/openness-and-value-in-the-digital-health-sector)explains\\nthis dynamic further: \u201cThe misconception of open source as \u2018free\u2019 may be better\\nunderstood through the Romance languages. Open source is\\n[libre, not gratis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre): free as\\nin speech, not as in lunch. In the case of many low resource settings, this is\\nthe right kind of free. The need for adaptability is balanced by the ability to\\nadapt a software.\u201d\\n\\nAn example of a successful open source software project that is also classified\\nas a digital public good is [OpenLMIS](https://openlmis.org/). OpenLMIS is the\\nleading logistics system used to track health products across national supply\\nchains and while they credit their open source approach as being responsible for\\ntheir deployment success to date, they have also experienced challenges related\\nto their business model. Business model challenges force open source project\\nmaintainers like OpenLMIS and OpenFn to explore different types of revenue\\nstreams that ensure long term sustainability of the projects.\\n\\n### How OpenFn\u2019s business model will enable long term sustainability of its open source project\\n\\nHistorically, lacking grant funding and without outside investors, OpenFn\\ndecided that the best way to continue delivering high-impact implementations and\\nkeep a laser focus on the needs of real-world NGOs that we serve was to build a\\nlicensed, closed-source software-as-a-service (SaaS) product offering (see\\n[openfn.org](http://www.openfn.org)). This product is dependent on the huge\\nsuite of open-source software that we continue to invest in for the good of the\\nlarger community\u2014\u201ccore\u201d, \u201cadaptors\u201d, and almost all of the software we build is\\nopen source\u2014but by licensing our SaaS we\u2019ve been able to create a steady stream\\nof revenue that is only dependent on real-world customers seeing and paying for\\nthe value they get by using the product. Selling subscriptions to the OpenFn\\nplatform has not only helped it grow into a strong, trusted, enterprise-grade\\nproduct, but it has bootstrapped our implementation arm, subsidized our \u201cfree\\nforever\u201d enterprise tier, and funded the further development of our open source\\ntools.\\n\\nThanks to recent support from DIAL, DFID and Digital Square, OpenFn is now able\\nto invest more time and energy into our open-source tools\u2014building new software\\nto compete with and complement more directly our licensed platform and working\\nto make the existing tools more accessible to a wider audience.The licensed\\nplatform and our open source project have a symbiotic relationship with one\\nanother. Open source innovation drives platform innovation and vice versa.\\nCrucially, both rely on each other.\\n\\nWith a more robust [open source offering ](/documentation/microservice/home)and\\na heavy investment in documentation, it will be easier than ever for\\norganizations to get up and running with OpenFn and then choose whether they\\nwant to scale their solutions on the platform or deploy them on their own\\ninfrastructure using nothing but free open source software (FOSS).\\n\\nSome will still choose to use our hosted offering, and we\u2019ll be encouraged to\\nfurther differentiate that offering through the value that it provides\u2014\\\\_not\\n\\\\_merely by virtue of it being proprietary. In fact, we see a future in which\\nNGOs and governments may shift seamlessly between all of our tools. We\u2019ve\\ndeveloped them with exactly this in mind, ensuring zero lock-in despite the\\nvarying licenses.\\n\\n### What does this mean, concretely?\\n\\nIn the past it was quite challenging to use OpenFn\u2019s open source tools, and we\\nfeel that they didn\u2019t provide enough functionality, out-of-the-box, to our\\nusers. It\u2019s not surprising to find, then, that almost all of OpenFn\u2019s users were\\non the proprietary platform. Going forward our\\n[open source integration toolkit](/documentation/deploy/options), including\\nOpenFn/devtools, OpenFn/core, OpenFn/engine, and OpenFn/microservice, will be\\nmore robust, user friendly and accessible. This means that anyone, anywhere can\\nbuild integration and automation solutions more quickly and interoperability\\nsolutions will be within reach to organizations with varying technical\\ncapabilities.\\n\\n:::caution Microservice and devtools are being replaced by Lightning\\n\\nPlease note that [OpenFn/microservice](https://github.com/OpenFn/microservice)\\nand [OpenFn/devtools](https://github.com/OpenFn/devtools) are being deprecated\\nand replaced by [OpenFn/Lightning](https://github.com/OpenFn/lightning), When\\nlighting is released.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nVersatility is a key component of our open source vision. We are constructing a\\nsystem that users can grow and mature with. While our enterprise platform might\\nbe right for your organization today, 5 years from now, once your organization\\nhas its own dedicated IT team and server infrastructure, local deployment via\\nmicroservice might make better sense. The good news is that OpenFn integration\\n[portability](/documentation/portability) will make these transitions easy. Your\\nintegration will run just as well on your servers as ours.\\n\\nAs the diagram below demonstrates we envision two main pathways for OpenFn\\nintegrations. The tech savvy project manager will configure their workflows via\\nour intuitive platform, while the power IT user will configure their workflows\\nfrom the command line. Regardless of the chosen approach, there is flexibility\\nto change paths whenever required.\\n\\n![Deployment Paths](/img/deployment_paths.png)\\n\\nAgain, _concretely_, this means our users will have more and better options for\\nhow they run their data integration solutions. While they might use\\nOpenFn/platform to build and test solutions, they could easily choose to run\\nthose same solutions on their own servers via OpenFn/microservice.

Additionally, the secure workflows the automation\\nallows\u2014critically, facilitating the complex referral process\u2014brings the child\\nprotection system in Cambodia one step closer to the collective dream of\\nproviding holistic, compassionate care.\\n\\n### The Key Partners\\n\\nThe Child Protection team at UNICEF Cambodia, working in concert with the\\ncountry\u2019s Child Welfare Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans\\nand Youth Rehabilitation (MoSVY) defined the scope of the interoperability\\nrequirements and guided this program\u2019s implementation. Because achieving\\ninteroperability can be complex, OpenFn was brought into the consortium to offer\\nexpert integration insights and to provide the digital infrastructure required\\nto enable the program\u2019s goals.\\n\\n### The Systems Integrated\\n\\nThe systems OpenFn integrated for the first phase of this project are\\n[Primero](https://www.primero.org/) and [OSCaR](https://oscarhq.com/). Primero\\nis an open source software platform that helps social services, humanitarian and\\ndevelopment workers manage protection-related data, with modules that facilitate\\ncase management, incident monitoring and family tracing and reunification. OSCaR\\n(Open Source Case-management and Record-keeping) is a case management software\\nsystem that is used by civil society organizations in Cambodia to manage cases\\nor children in residential care.\\n\\n![Primero OpenFn Oscar Diagram](/img/primero_oscar.png)\\n\\nFirst a definition: \u201cInteroperability\u201d, in this context, is the automated\\nability of computer systems to work in concert with (sharing data and\\ncollaborating on processes with) other systems. Defining interoperability is the\\neasy part; achieving it is another story. \u201cIn a complex, interagency project\\nlike this, it\u2019s true that the technologies in play often don\u2019t \u2018speak the same\\nlanguage\u2019, but neither do the partners,\u201d writes Aleksa Krolls, OpenFn\u2019s Head of\\nServices. \u201cOur job is not only to facilitate the flow of data between systems,\\nbut to facilitate the process by which our partners\u2014human users\u2014communicate\\nmeaning across multiple agencies and people.\u201d\\n\\nIn this example, OpenFn\u2019s software is acting as the \u201ctranslator\u201d between the\\nOSCaR and Primero systems. OpenFn\u2019s primary interoperability objective for this\\nfirst phase was to facilitate Cambodian government partners and local\\nnon-governmental organizations in systematic registration and tracking of\\nchildren in Cambodia, including facilitating duplicate detection between systems\\nand enabling easy-to-use processes for updating beneficiary/client details.\\n\\n### The work is just beginning\\n\\nOpenFn\u2019s work with UNICEF Cambodia and the MoSVY doesn\u2019t end here though. We are\\nnow beginning the process of enabling further Primero interoperability with\\nsoftware like ProGres v2, UNHCR\u2019s institutional tool, as well as enabling\\nPrimero-to-Primero implementations in the field. We\u2019ll be sure to keep the\\ncommunity updated as the project progresses.\\n\\nMany of the best responses to the critical issues we face as a society emerge\\nfrom collaboration and interoperability enables collaboration in the digital\\ndomain. Just as no single actor or organization can deliver all the services\\nrequired to protect vulnerable children and survivors of violence, no single\\ntechnology can be successful operating in isolation.\\n\\nCase management automation allows for a social worker to spend more time being\\nthere for the vulnerable populations they serve and less time copying and\\npasting data between the applications they use. This partnership between OpenFn,\\nUNICEF Cambodia and the MoSVY means that fewer children will need to painfully\\nre-tell their traumas just to receive the help they need.\\n\\nIf your organization is in the health and humanitarian sector and is thinking\\nabout automation and interoperability, contact services@openfn.org for a free\\nconsultation.\\n\\n**About UNICEF Cambodia:** UNICEF Cambodia\u2019s mission is to promote the healthy\\ndevelopment of children, to defend their rights and help them fulfil their\\npotential, from early childhood to adolescence.\\n\\n**About Cambodia\u2019s Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation\\n(MoSVY):** Cambodia\u2019s MoSVY is a government agency with a broad mandate that\\nincludes supporting the efforts of social workers across the country.\\n\\n**About OpenFn Group:** Open Function Group (\u201cOFG\u201d) helps health and\\nhumanitarian interventions in 40+ countries achieve scale and improve service\\ndelivery through automation, data integration, and interoperability solutions."},{"id":"/2020/07/27/nalibali-case-study","metadata":{"permalink":"/fr/blog/2020/07/27/nalibali-case-study","editUrl":"https://github.com/openfn/docs/edit/main/blog/2020-07-27-nalibali-case-study.md","source":"@site/blog/2020-07-27-nalibali-case-study.md","title":"Connecting Beneficiaries, Data, and SMS to Expand the Reach of Literacy Groups Across South Africa","description":"Nal\u2019ibali is on a mission to change education across South Africa through its","date":"2020-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"27 juillet 2020","tags":[{"label":"case study","permalink":"/fr/blog/tags/case-study"},{"label":"education","permalink":"/fr/blog/tags/education"},{"label":"odk","permalink":"/fr/blog/tags/odk"},{"label":"Salesforce","permalink":"/fr/blog/tags/salesforce"},{"label":"SMS","permalink":"/fr/blog/tags/sms"},{"label":"learning management system","permalink":"/fr/blog/tags/learning-management-system"}],"readingTime":2.435,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Lei Tun","url":"https://github.com/hninleileitun","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/hninleileitun"}],"frontMatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Connecting Beneficiaries, Data, and SMS to Expand the Reach of Literacy Groups Across South Africa","author":"Lei Lei Tun","author_url":"https://github.com/hninleileitun","author_image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/hninleileitun","tags":["case study","education","odk","Salesforce","SMS","learning management system"],"image":"/img/nalibali.jpg"},"prevItem":{"title":"Enabling Interoperability for Child Case Referrals in Cambodia","permalink":"/fr/blog/2021/02/09/interoperability_for_case_referrals"},"nextItem":{"title":"Keeping Track of Payments to Help Sinapis Scale Small, Growing Businesses in Africa","permalink":"/fr/blog/2020/07/26/sinapis-case-study"}},"content":"Nal\u2019ibali is on a mission to change education across South Africa through its\\nreading-for-enjoyment initiative, which promotes reading and writing in mother\\ntongue languages.

Children who aren\u2019t good readers at a primary school\\nlevel are on a trajectory of limited educational progress. Nal\u2019ibali aims to\\nimprove academic success by promoting reading and writing in mother tongue\\nlanguages, which is important in a country that has has 11 official languages.\\n\\n### Nal\'ibali uses language and cultural relevance to develop literacy in a nationwide campaign.\\n\\n[Nal\u2019ibali](https://www.nalibali.org/) (isiXhosa for \'here\'s the story\') is a\\nnational reading-for-enjoyment initiative to use the power of stories, either\\noral or written and in many different languages, to inspire children to want to\\nread and write. Since this campaign began in 2012, it has had a tremendous\\nimpact across South Africa through: 11,132 reading clubs (5220 of which are\\ncurrently active), 159,191 participants, and 1,419,035 stories distributed.\\n\\n### With multiple systems and programs, there was no single-view of children\'s literacy progress.\\n\\nTo manage its nationwide literacy campaign, Nal\'ibali used a collection of\\ntechnology platforms for data collection, reporting, and program management.\\nNal\'ibali implemented Salesforce for enhanced data management. However,\\nNal\'ibali still needed to integrate its OpenDataKit (ODK) data collection tools\\nand online learning management system with Salesforce to track the entire\\nprogram journey and progress of a child beneficiary in one, single-view.\\n\\n### OpenFn integrates online and offline data sources so that Nal\'ibali can monitor children\'s progress across _all_ literacy programs.\\n\\nTo integrate siloed data sources and introduce automated SMS to boost reader\\nengagement, Nal\u2019ibali implemented OpenFn to:\\n\\n1. sync all data collection tools across programs and activities for single-view\\n   monitoring,\\n2. integrate Salesforce with Everlytic SMS to support direct communication with\\n   beneficiaries, and\\n3. enable live monitoring of its reach through a live, integrated map\\n   visualization that tracks the locations of reading clubs\\n\\nThese OpenFn-powered integrations save the Nal\u2019ibali team several hours every\\nmonth on data management processes and activity reporting.

The foundation began an HIV program in Haiti in 2007\\nto support the healthy development of children and families by tracking and\\nassisting the clinical follow-up of HIV positive and HIV vulnerable pregnant\\nwomen, mothers, and children.\\n\\nIn collaboration with the Ministry of Health, the National Laboratory of Public\\nHealth (read more\\n[here](https://www.fondation-merieux.org/en/news/the-ministry-of-public-health-and-population-launches-haitis-first-national-laboratory-policy/)\\nas well as other hospitals and organizations operating in Haiti, the Caris\\nFoundation currently supports 150 hospitals across all 10 provinces, including\\nsupport in hard-to-reach districts and remote islands.\\n\\n### Operating across 7 regional offices, Caris Foundation\u2019s network provides coverage to over 95% of the Haitian population.\\n\\nAs part of Caris Foundation\u2019s health worker outreach program, community health\\nworkers (\\"CHWs\\") complete daily home visits to children and pregnant women with\\nsuspected lapses in clinical and drug adherence. During these visits, CHWs\\nprovide vital services such as counseling for clinical adherence, nutrition\\nscreening and distribution of essential health supplies like ARV medication,\\nalbendazole, and chlorine for water treatment. These services support\\nbeneficiaries to regularly attend medical appointments, adhere to drug treatment\\nregimens, receive appropriate lab tests, and seek treatment for new or worsening\\nhealth problems.\\n\\n### Disconnected systems created week- and months-long reporting lags.\\n\\nCaris implemented [CommCare](https://dimagi.com/commcare/) to enable CHWs to\\ncollect data offline via mobile phone when working in remote environments.\\nHowever, all data collected for analysis, such as beneficiary profiles, services\\nreceived, and follow-up visits, needed to be manually transcribed via paper\\ncopies into the HIV Haiti MySQL database. This process would take a week (and up\\nto several months) to complete, and sometimes the data collected would never\\nmake it to the database.\\n\\n### OpenFn data integration saves Caris Foundation staff thousands of hours, enabling live, automated reporting.\\n\\nOpenFn automatically processes and uploads data from approximately 5000 HIV\\nvisits every month. Once in the database, the Caris Foundation is able to track\\nthe progress of mothers and children as services are delivered in the field.\\n\\nTo date, OpenFn has automatically cleaned and uploaded 100,000+ CommCare\\nsubmissions to the MySQL HIV database, saving Caris thousands of staff hours\\npreviously spent on data entry and reporting processes.

In this post, we highlight our partner\\nmyAgro, an organization leveraging OpenFn automation to help scale its programs\\ntowards its goal of serving 1 million farmers in 2025.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n![myAgro](/img/myAgro1.JPG)\\n\\n### Here\'s the overview.\\n\\n[myAgro](https://www.myagro.org/) has pioneered an innovative bankless savings\\nplan that allows thousands of farmers to finance themselves and invest their\\nmoney in high-quality seeds, fertilizer, tools, and training. OpenFn automates\\nmyAgro\u2019s mobile layaway platform, powering a system where farmers can\\nincrementally pay for agricultural inputs by purchasing savings vouchers in\\nlocal stores\u2014making deposits via SMS. myAgro holds those layaway payments until\\nplanting time, when bulk purchases of seeds, fertilizers, and tools are\\ndelivered to the farmers based on individualized plans.\\n\\n### What is myAgro?\\n\\nmyAgro helps thousands of farmers in Senegal and Mali save money for seed and\\nfertilizer using what they already have\u2014their mobile phone. With a mission to\\nmove small-scale farmers out of poverty, myAgro leveraged OpenFn to develop a\\nmobile layaway platform that connects their Telerivet SMS-based savings deposit\\nsystem, Salesforce farmer tracking & supply chain system, and CommCare\\nbarcode-scanning mobile app.\\n\\n![myagro](/img/farmers.jpg)\\n\\n### Using Excel and paper to manage thousands of farmer transactions.\\n\\nIn 2014, myAgro utilized [Telerivet](https://telerivet.com/), an instant SMS and\\nvoice platform, to capture farmer savings deposits, and paper to track voucher\\nshipments. They would then regularly export the SMS data to an Excel\\nspreadsheet, and manually match savings deposits against a database of vouchers\\nbefore allocating credit to a farmer\u2019s account and sending a confirmation SMS.\\nStaff spent 1-2 hours per day (or 261+ hours per year) on this data\\nreconciliation process, which had high potential for human error.\\n\\n### Where OpenFn comes in...\\n\\nOpenFn moved this entire manual process over to the cloud, automating the\\nsavings deposit system and connecting a CommCare barcode-scanning mobile app for\\nreal-time farmer order management and inventory tracking. By integrating\\nTelerivet and Salesforce, myAgro no longer has to rely on data entries and\\nuploads that would take 1-2 hours each day.\\n\\nOpenFn now processes all SMS messages automatically, builds trust by providing\\ninstant confirmation to farmers, and eliminates the chance of human error in\\nsavings allocations. OpenFn helped myAgro transition from managing rows and\\ncolumns of data in an Excel spreadsheet to an automated savings and inventory\\ntracking system that enables real-time program monitoring.\\n\\n- In 2014, myAgro serviced 14,000 farmers across 200 villages in Senegal and\\n  Mali.\\n- With the help of OpenFn, myAgro worked with 120,000 farmers in 2019, and plans\\n  to scale towards its goal of reaching `1 million farmers` by 2025.\\n\\n![myagro](/img/myagrograph.jpg)\\n\\nRead more about myAgro\u2019s mission [here](https://www.myagro.org/), and stay tuned\\nas myAgro continues to scale its OpenFn implementation."},{"id":"/2020/06/04/Building-Integrated-Systems-That-Just-Work","metadata":{"permalink":"/fr/blog/2020/06/04/Building-Integrated-Systems-That-Just-Work","editUrl":"https://github.com/openfn/docs/edit/main/blog/2020-06-04-Building-Integrated-Systems-That-Just-Work.md","source":"@site/blog/2020-06-04-Building-Integrated-Systems-That-Just-Work.md","title":"Building Integrated Systems That Just Work","description":"OpenFn provides the \\"Rosetta Stone\\" for your technologies and integrates any","date":"2020-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"4 juin 2020","tags":[{"label":"tips","permalink":"/fr/blog/tags/tips"}],"readingTime":5.02,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Taylor Downs","url":"https://github.com/taylordowns2000","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/taylordowns2000"}],"frontMatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Building Integrated Systems That Just Work","author":"Taylor Downs","author_url":"https://github.com/taylordowns2000","author_image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/taylordowns2000","tags":["tips"],"image":"/img/roads.jpg","featured":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Enabling Scale at myAgro, 6 Years Later","permalink":"/fr/blog/2020/06/09/enabling-scale-at-myagro"},"nextItem":{"title":"Technology Is Not The Answer, but It Should Not Be The Problem","permalink":"/fr/blog/2020/06/04/Technology-Isnt-The-Answer"}},"content":"OpenFn provides the \\"Rosetta Stone\\" for your technologies and integrates any\\napp.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n![roads](/img/roads.jpg)\\n\\n_This article was originally posted by Taylor Downs, Head of Product, on\\n[The OpenFn Founder\'s blog](https://medium.com/@taylordowns2000) as \\"Making\\ntechnology work better in the social sector.\\"_\\n\\n#### We\'re building a tool that will make integrating critical social-impact technologies trivial.\\n\\nThe words \u201cintegrating\u201d and \u201ctrivial\u201d are not often written in the same sentence\\n\u2014 and for good reason! Non-technical readers click away when they read the\\nformer, while developers see the latter and think it\u2019s nonsense! (i.e.,\\nIntegration is NEVER trivial.) This doesn\u2019t leave a lot of you left here on\\nsentence number 5. Thanks for sticking it out, and let me reward your patience\\nby explaining why this is such a big deal and what we need from you to make it\\nhappen.\\n\\nBy leveraging technology, we can make social programs more effective. Bigger,\\nbetter, more complete solutions to issues of poverty, public health, and human\\nrights are not only possible, but seem to be right on our doorstep thanks to\\ntremendous advances in information technology in the last 25 years. Thousands of\\ntools have been developed to address all sorts of needs across international\\ndevelopment. While the tools and use-cases vary tremendously, there\u2019s always one\\nugly, expensive, technically complex constant lurking in the background.\\n\\n(Enter \u201cintegration\u201d stage left.)\\n\\nJust as \u201cno man is an island\u201d, no single piece of technology can stand alone. We\\nrely on integrations every day. Many applications are so tightly integrated that\\nwe hardly notice. Gmail and Google Contacts almost behave like a single app. If\\nyou\u2019re lucky, Gmail and your calendar are also integrated. If you sync a folder\\non your computer to Dropbox, there\u2019s a nifty integration between your local\\noperating system and Dropbox.com. All of these integrations save precious time \u2014\\nthey cut out a tedious manual step like uploading a copy of each photo you save\\non your computer to a website.\\n\\nNow imagine running a pediatric HIV clinic in Kenya. Beyond email, a calendar,\\nand Dropbox, you rely on a fingerprint scanner to to quickly access patient IDs,\\na smart-phone based data collection app for new patient intake during home\\nvisits, an electronic medical record system to manage patient data securely, and\\nan automated SsocMS service to notify workers and patients of upcoming visits.\\n\\n#### We should take a moment to be thankful for the progress we\u2019ve made in \u201cICT4D\u201d. It\u2019s amazing that these technologies exist. They save time, money, and lives.\\n\\nThe problem is that, for lack of a better metaphor, these technologies all speak\\ndifferent languages. You can ask users to download data from one, make sense of\\nit, and then upload it to another, but that\u2019s a slow, expensive, and error-prone\\ntask. (Not to mention the non-negligible fact that it\u2019s horribly boring.) To get\\nthe tos working together automatically you\u2019re talking tens of thousands of\\ndollars, and the integration you\u2019re left with isn\u2019t re-usable once your needs\\nchange. What\u2019s worse is that every time a new technology is implemented within\\nan organization, consultants and developers must struggle anew to integrate it\\nwith existing systems because there\u2019s seldom the budget or foresight required to\\nbuild a truly flexible and future-proof integration. This is the issue we\u2019re\\ntackling, head on.\\n\\n#### OpenFn is a \u201cRosetta Stone\u201d that makes automating the constant flow of crucial information from one system to another as easy as point-and-click.\\n\\nGoogle.org called OpenFn\u2019s attempt to provide easy and technology agnostic data\\nintegration \u201cthe holy grail.\u201d Stu, our own chief engineer had the same notion.\\nAfter some hard work, it seems that the platform may really be that powerful,\\nbut also far more attainable. Here\u2019s how we do it:\\n\\nWe use (1) a universal standard for data storage, (2) standard information about\\nwhat kinds of data are expected from \u201csource applications\u201d and \u201cdestination\\napplications\u201d, and (3) a user-friendly interface to generate \u201cjobs\u201d\u2014sometimes\\ncalled \u201cautomation scripts\u201d or instructions for how to process data.\\n\\n#### A job might be to create a new patient record when fingerprints are scanned. Once a job is created, it can simply be \u201cswitched on\u201d to run in the background while the human beings at your organization focus on much more important (and interesting!) things.\\n\\nFor those of you who work in technology, the power of this strategy (namely,\\nusing a universal standard) should be apparent. To integrate a new application,\\na small adapter that translates data to JSON and provides a JSON-schema for your\\ndatabase is all that\u2019s required. Once one API connection to OpenFn is\\nestablished, **_your technology is instantly connected to every other technology\\nconnected to OpenFn\u2013and OpenFn can connect any application._** It will start to\\nsnowball quickly, allowing data to flow instantly between hundreds of crucial\\napplications, and each developer will only ever need to maintain a single\\nconnection.\\n\\n![apps](/img/apps.png)\\n\\nDozens of organizations worldwide use OpenFn to scale their interventions by\\nautomating key processes and information flows. OpenFn solutions deliver\\ncritical information, faster and unlock resources for organizations by\\neliminating manual, time-intensive tasks. OpenFn connects any app\u2013including\\ncommon ICT4D tools like DHIS2, CommCare, Kobo Toolbox, and Salesforce, as well\\nas databases, custom applications, and legacy systems. Drop us a note if you\u2019re\\nthinking about how to connect tools at your organization, or if you\u2019re a\\ndeveloper and wondering how to get your product connected to other essential\\ntools in international development.\\n\\nIn the end, we\u2019re talking about making it orders of magnitude faster and\\nsignificantly less expensive to integrate key technologies. By automating the\\nflow of data in social impact organizations we eliminate human error and reduce\\nlag time\u2014this means better information in the hands of decision makers, faster.\\nAll this leads to one thing: bigger, better, and more complete solutions to some\\nof the world\'s biggest problems.\\n\\nIf you\u2019d just like some more information about OpenFn and how we help leading\\nimpact-first organizations scale their interventions, head over to\\n[Solution Overviews - OpenFn.](https://www.openfn.org/solutions) To get all the\\nlatest OpenFn updates, like us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/openfn)\\nand follow us on [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/openfn)"},{"id":"/2020/06/04/Technology-Isnt-The-Answer","metadata":{"permalink":"/fr/blog/2020/06/04/Technology-Isnt-The-Answer","editUrl":"https://github.com/openfn/docs/edit/main/blog/2020-06-04-Technology-Isnt-The-Answer.md","source":"@site/blog/2020-06-04-Technology-Isnt-The-Answer.md","title":"Technology Is Not The Answer, but It Should Not Be The Problem","description":"OpenFn\u2019s first objective is to knock down the technical hurdles so organizations","date":"2020-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"4 juin 2020","tags":[{"label":"tips","permalink":"/fr/blog/tags/tips"}],"readingTime":2.95,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Taylor Downs","url":"https://github.com/taylordowns2000","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/taylordowns2000"}],"frontMatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Technology Is Not The Answer, but It Should Not Be The Problem","author":"Taylor Downs","author_url":"https://github.com/taylordowns2000","author_image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/taylordowns2000","tags":["tips"],"image":"/img/technology1.jpg","featured":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Building Integrated Systems That Just Work","permalink":"/fr/blog/2020/06/04/Building-Integrated-Systems-That-Just-Work"},"nextItem":{"title":"Announcing the new OpenFn Blog","permalink":"/fr/blog/2020/05/31/the-new-openfn-blog"}},"content":"OpenFn\u2019s first objective is to knock down the technical hurdles so organizations\\ncan focus on the important contextual stuff.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n![tech1](/img/technology1.jpg)\\n\\n_This article was originally posted by Taylor Downs, Head of Product, on\\n[The OpenFn Founder\'s blog](https://medium.com/@taylordowns2000) as \\"Technology\\nisn\'t the answer, but it shouldn\'t be the problem.\\"_\\n\\nMarch 23, 2015 \u2014 Salesforce Foundation originally published\\n[this blog post.](https://www.salesforce.org/technology-isnt-answer-shouldnt-problem/)\\n\\nThree out of four IT implementations fail.
